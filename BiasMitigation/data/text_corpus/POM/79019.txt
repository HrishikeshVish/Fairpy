This is The Weather Man with Nicolas (stutter) Cage, I'm sorry. (umm) It's a really good movie, it's kind of got a dry humor to it. (umm) It is rated R so I don't recommend it for kids. (umm)

It's a hundred and one minutes. (uhh) There's a lot of special features on this one too. (umm) Extended outlooks, the script, (umm) atmosphere pressure, the style, (umm) characters, (umm) just all kinds of different stuff. (umm) But I'd recommend picking this up, it's pretty funny. Like I said it's a dry humor so some kids might, well it's rated R but some of the older kids might not like it and some might really love it. (umm) But I'd recommend picking it up, it's a pretty good movie (umm) and you can pick it up at any place that sells DVDs or go to amazon dot com (umm)

and pick it up.

And that is The Weather Man.
