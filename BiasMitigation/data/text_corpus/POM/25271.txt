Hi I'm Jesse and (uhh) today I'm going to talk to you for just a brief moment about Stanley Kubrick's two thousand one A space Odyssey. And I took the word brief very poignantly because this movie is anything but. It's (uhh) about, yeah it says here, four thousand minutes long which it translates to over forty hours somehow and (umm). 

Sure it's a classic and there's a lot of symbolism that you see all over in in (stutter) our culture, (uhh) especially The Simpson's. But (uhh)

And and (stutter) of course that whole I'm afraid I can't do that Dave is from this. And so, you kind of have to see this at some point on your life just so you know what it's about. But (uhh) if you're looking to have like a nice relaxing time or if you really enjoy science fiction, (umm) 

spend your money elsewhere. This movie is immensely boring. There's one part where they (uhh) go to Mars or something and they show the entire trip to Mars like unabridged. It's it's (stutter) like four days where they're just in stasis and the camera moves around occasionally. It's like a surveillance camera on a spaceship. It's (uhh) incredibly boring. But there's (stutter) I guess there's some neat ideas or something cause I (uhh) {laugh}

I couldn't, I was asleep for most of it but people just, that's what I'm reading on the internet. Anyway (uhh) I really (uhh) not a good movie (uhh) classic but no.
