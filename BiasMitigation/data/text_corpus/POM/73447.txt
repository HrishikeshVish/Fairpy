Hi. This is Dan with my review of Dogville on DVD. Ouch. This movie sucked. (umm) If there was a movie that could be any worse than this, I'd probably call it a play, which is what basically this was as a movie. (uhh) It earns a hearty one out of five stars in my opinion, even though it stars a (uhh) well known and, I think personally, great actress, Nicole Kidman. I just think the whole setup of Dogville (uhh) just, it was weak. It felt like you were looking at Harry Potter's little map, his magic map, with people walking around, and that was the set and that was the whole movie. Yes, we had to actually fast forward this chapter by chapter just to make sure there was never going to be any real scenery or real set to look at. Very disappointing. Dogville (umm), you know from the back of the cover seemed to be kind of interesting, but the way that the screenplay and they set it up basically was a stage act with little more than props as furniture and also black backdrops just to sort of see this whole thing play out. (umm) Never got really into the movie (uhh) because it was just so distracting, and not immersive. It felt like you were sitting in a theater and (umm) sort of tricked into it. Especially since it's a movie you know. So (umm)

It's rated R. I would not recommend it, especially if you thought it was a movie. Well, it's not even a movie at that. So Dogville, one out of five stars. This is Dan with my review of it.
