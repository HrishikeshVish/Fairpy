South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut. I actually got this movie probably about ten years ago. It was a movie I liked to watch when I played hooky to stay home and when I was faking being or being sick.

I watched this movie. It was funny at the time.

As I got older this movie became less and less funny. 

(uhh) I can't really say South Park is stupid,

but it actually is. My girlfriend loves it though.

(uhh) It's just not that funny, (uhh) you know unless you like (uhh) jokes dealing with bodily functions and (uhh) little kids dropping the f bomb. Actually Cartman's kind of funny. The dealings with Cartman, that makes me smile every time.

(uhh) The homosexuality between Satan and Saddam

it's not very funny. It's kind of weird.

(umm) I actually might need to watch this now that Saddam is actually no longer on this earth, because you can probably kind of picture Saddam being down there with Satan, you know.

(umm) You know, I think that's pretty evil really.

So, anyways, South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, one out of five.
