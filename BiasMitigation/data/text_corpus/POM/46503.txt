Today I'm going to be doing a (stutter) a movie review of a movie that is currently in theaters right now (uhh) titled Three-Hundred. (uhh) Three-Hundred (ehh) basically tells the story of an ancient Greece battle. (umm)

(uhh) One king and his three-hundred Spartans who (uhh) fought against Xerxes and his massive Persian army. (uhh) Basically (uhh) they face insurmountable odds and overcame (uhh) sorta this great battle. (umm) Basically this is from the same creator of Sin City and it has some of that same feel to it. (umm) This movie was shot in (uhh) sixty days I read (umm) but actually took an entire year later of (uhh) doing special effects editing. So that's just kind of crazy, it gives you an idea of some of the like (umm)

fictional elements involved in this story. (umm) Basically the movie is superbly acted, (uhh) the action is incredible, (umm)

the drama and adaptation of war are (uhh) very realistic and I think that (uhh) this is a combination of sort of the old (umm) Braveheart (uhh) mixed with some of the new (uhh)

kind of like (uhh)

incredible (uhh) animation and (uhh) just kind of crazy lighting effects that you can expect from the director of Sin City. (umm) So I think if you're looking for a good action adventure (uhh) war type drama movie I would check out Three-Hundred.
