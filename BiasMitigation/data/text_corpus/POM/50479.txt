This is video review for Flash Gordon.

This movie is, this is the widescreen version.

(uhh) The rating 

is PG.

The genre is (uhh)

is action sci-fi kinda.

And the length of the movie is one-hundred-eleven minutes. 

This movie is about a, (uhh) is about a (stutter) guy, 

that is a football player for the New York Jets, star quarter back. 

And he's, 

he gets on a plane 

and he gets interviewed (stutter) he is getting fixed to get interviewed by,

some woman and then all of the sudden, 

some 

(stutter) aliens 

start taking over the planet and they transport their airplane

to the, to the (stutter) other planet. 

And so 

they're they're (stutter) on that other planet 

and it's all about them trying to get off. 

There, a scientist gets on with them too. 

You'll see how if you, if you (stutter) watch it, 

but a scientist gets on with them. 

And so it's the three of them that get on that new planet 

and they don't know what to do. 

And it's all about them trying to escape. 

And (uhh) it's a really good movie, 

it's one of my, it's a older movie, 

but (uhh) it's it's (stutter) a good movie and I'd recommend it.

And that's my video review Flash Gordon.
