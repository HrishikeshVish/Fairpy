Howdy guys, this is Cade and this is me doing a review of the Director's Cut DVD version of Bladerunner. (uhh) this is a classic science fiction film. You've got Harrison Ford playing this character that initially hunts down renegade robots in the future when there is like, a lot of population is cyborg or what not. 

And a bunch of these cyborgs actually go and wreak havoc on the future city, you see here is some crazy stuff going on. You got some floating cars and what not and crazy buildings. 

(umm) Among other people in this, Darryl Hannah's in this. Also, Edward James Olmos and Sean Young as well as (uhh)

Rutger Hauer. I'm not sure if that's how you pronounce his last name, but he's like a creepy German guy that's in a whole lot like, Steven Segal movies and stuff like that. This guy.

So like I said, this is regarded as a classic. If you've never heard of it or never seen it then obviously you should. But it's definitely one of the best science fiction movies out there. It's very suspenseful and very cool and edgy. 

xxx and there's something sort of goth about it as well. And this is the director's cut which means it's a lot more footage and this is how the director wanted it.

Five out of five stars. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.
