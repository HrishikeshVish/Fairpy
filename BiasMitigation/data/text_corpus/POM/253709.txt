Hey Expo TV, this is Kevin and this is my review on Elf, starring Will Ferrell. (umm)

It's not like a weird movie for me because (uhh) a lot of people didn't seem to like it. I don't know if it's because (uhh) it's not the typical Will Ferrell we're used to seeing. (umm) But I really found a lot of humor in it and I thought it was really funny and a great family movie and (uhh) great for the holidays too. It's a Christmas movie. (uhh) Holidays are coming around. Definitely wanna wanna (stutter) go check it out. This particular DVD (umm) has the widescreen and the full screen editions in there and (uhh)

a lot of (uhh) bonus features and stuff. Games and stuff for the kids. (umm) (stutters) Behind the scenes (uhh) special (umm) like deleted scenes and stuff like that. Great movie though. (uhh) Definitely not the Will Ferrell we're used to seeing. (uhh) He's toned it down for the kids I guess. (uhh) You know, I think that really shows something about his character. He's (uhh) he's a great actor and (uhh) definitely a great movie. So (uhh) don't be hesitant, to be oh it's Will Ferrell, we can't let the kids watch it. But it's definitely a good family movie and I definitely recommend it. So (uhh) go check it out and (umm) I'm sure you'll like it.
