Hi.

Today I'm reviewing the movie Bridge to Terabithia.

In this movie the main, the two main characters are young children.

(uhh) one is a girl that just moved in, the other is a boy that lives

close to this girl. The girl had never really made very many friends,

and the boy really doesn't have that many friends either.

(uhh) if you see the previews, the previews shows a lot of animation and a lot of, like (uhh)

fictional characters that are in the movie.

(uhh) this is, to me, this movie was a very

big disappointment.

(uhh) it really didn't have that many fictional characters

or (stutter) they actually had every character that was shown,

but they're only there for like, if you took the whole movie, maybe a minute and a half, two minutes.

So, it was more, (uhh) you know, it, it (stutter) really didn't have the imaginary characters that you think the movie would have throughout the entire movie.

(uhh) I was disappointed also in in the (stutter) how the movie

(uhh) had a twist and it was a negative twist. And I think the kids need positive twists, not negative twists.

I thought overall the movie stunk.

You know, I mean

it was good, but it wasn't good because of the twists it had and

I'm not going to tell you what the twist was, but you'll see what it is,

and I usually like to have children's movies that have happy, happy movies throughout the entire movie and not to have disappointment in the movie.

So, overall I give this movie thumbs down.
