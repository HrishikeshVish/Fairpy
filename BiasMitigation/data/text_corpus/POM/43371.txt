Hi, today I'm going to be reviewing the movie MouseHunt.

(umm) It's supposedly the funniest movie of the year, it says on the DVD. It stars Nathan Lane and Lee Evans. 

(umm) 

It's (uhh) PG, and it's about an hour and thirty minutes. 

(umm) It has some special features on the DVD of 

(umm) production notes, cast and filmmaker's biographies and stuff. 

Not too much, but

(uhh) the movie itself 

(umm) 

is okay. 

(umm) 

Well, it's supposed to be the funniest movie of the year, but {sigh} I don't really think that's true. (umm)

It's kind of one of those silly type of funny movies. (umm) 

So I don't know if you enjoy that. (umm) 

I tend not to like those {noise} type of movies, because I don't know, they're not really funny to me.

But, if you wanna check it out, it's okay to see maybe once or twice. It's MouseHunt.
