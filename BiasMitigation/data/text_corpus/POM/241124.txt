Hello, my name is Sarah and I'll be doing my video opinion for the movie Arctic Tale. (umm)

basically the movie is a real life adventure, (umm) you know, a life in the eyes of a polar bear. (umm) and it also talks about a baby walrus. (umm) you know, so it basically goes through the struggles of survival that each arctic creature has to go through. (umm) you know, being a small (uhh) baby polar bear with, you know, the the (stutter) necessities you need in order to survive. How to feed yourself, how to keep yourself safe from any predators, you know, things like that. (umm) and with the baby walrus, you know, it you going to learn how to feed you going to learn how to be able to you know depend on yourself when your mother's not around. (umm) so that was was (stutter) very cool but this movie is just a real life, you know, message in here of survival you know whether it's an arctic creature or even a human, you know, what you need to accomplish in order to to (stutter) pretty much to survive so (umm) I really enjoyed this movie. (umm) It also reminded me of March of the Penguins so, you know, if you like those type of documentaries that describe real life adventures for real animals (umm) I think you'll really enjoy this one. So I enjoyed it and I think you will too, take a look at Arctic Tale.
