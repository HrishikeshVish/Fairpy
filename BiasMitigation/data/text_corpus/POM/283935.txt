Hey. ExpoTV I am DJ Mel here and I will be reviewing myself, no I am not so why did I tell you my name? Anyways, today I am reviewing (stutter) Denzel Washington's Deja Vu. This movie is, this movie is PG thirteen, thirteen, yes (umm) (uhh) This is starring

touched, no (stutter) that's not him I'm sorry (uhh) it is (uhh) brought to you by Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Touchstone Pictures. (umm) I would've, I watched this movie once, four years ago for something, didn't really like it, it's (stutter) suspenseful but, meaningless at the same time and it has a confusing plot so if you're looking for a good watch, like a classic watch like you're going to watch an old movie, (umm) and you're you're (stutter) looking for an action or a suspense movie,  don't get Deja Vu, you'll get like Shanghai Knights. Just any Jackie Chan movie will do. So {laughter} anyways, this this (stutter) not a great movie, so yeah, don't watch it. Thanks for watching.
