Hey, everyone on ExpoTV dot com. Now, today I'm going to be reviewing another movies in theaters called The Haunting in Connecticut. Now (umm) this is sort of, if you've ever seen the movie Poltergeist, then (uhh) this movie is pretty similar to that. It's basically this kid is being treated for cancer, so they relocate their house. And the house that (uhh) they move into has a dark history behind it basically.

And, you know, all this weird stuff goes on. And then they basically try to get help from a ghost hunter to drive, like, the evil spirits out of their house. (umm) Anyway, I didn't really find this movie (uhh) that good. It had some creepy moments, but I was expecting a lot more from the trailer. You see a lot more and it kind of freaks you out and wants you to go see it. But, you know, nothing really special. I didn't really catch onto anything.

It was a pretty plain movie anyway {yawn} but, you know, maybe maybe (stutter) (uhh) there will be other ones that come out. But this is not a good horror movie, I don't think, at least. I might be wrong. You can go check at, check it out and maybe prove me wrong. I don't really know. I can't really think of anything that was that good about it. It was okay. I mean, it was entertaining to watch, but nothing really had you thinking it really, nothing special. But I give this movie a

two out of five.
