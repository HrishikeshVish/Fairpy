Hi. 

(umm) today, the product that I'm going to review is a DVD. This is a double-feature DVD. It's Star Wars

the (umm) Ewok Adventures.

Now, (umm), like I said, it has two xxx. It has (stutter) (umm) two features. The first is The Caravan of Courage and then the other one is The Battle of Endor. 

And (umm) 

this is

the first one, the Caravan of Courage follows a family (umm) who has their

spaceship has crash landed on

I guess on the planet xxx, or (umm) populated by Ewoks.

And the the (stutter) mother and father of the young boy and girl have been captured (stutter) by almost an evil sorcerers.

And (uhh) 

it's there

they happen to be captured by Ewoks and are taken to their village. And then the Ewoks help them find their parents and to rescue them. The Battle of Endor is where (umm) the young boy and girl helped by the Ewoks try to leave 

(umm)

the planet, but something happens (umm) and there's a great battle, their parents die, and then they're trying to fight and (uhh) survive.

(uhh)

in that village where Ewoks live. You can find this at (uhh) Amazon dot com or even eBay for under twenty dollars.
