This is a review for the movie AntiTrust.  

(umm) The main actors in it are Ryan Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook, Claire Foriani, 

Forlani and Tim Robbins. (umm)

If I was a professional reviewer and I had to give this movie (uhh) you know a star rating, it would probably be like two out of five. 

(uhh) That being said it's still sort of a fun, 

(uhh) enjoyable movie to watch if you're not terribly concerned with, you know, genius level filmmaking. 

(umm) It's just, (uhh) sort of a fun movie. It kind of takes place where 

the main character's sort of, invited to work for 

(uhh) a Microsoft-like company, and (uhh) things are all sort of going on 

(uhh) in the company and he discovers it all, and it's sort of like, what happens from there.

(umm) 

You know (stutter) it's a, it's a (stutter) solid movie. It's rated PG thirteen, 

(uhh) so pretty much anyone can watch it.

(umm) It's only about, 

just slightly under two hours long. I think about an hour and forty-eight minutes. 

(uhh) 

But, you know, it's a solid movie that's sort of fun. I wouldn't try to impress anyone with it. It's not, like, great, by any means, (umm) but but (stutter) it's okay.
