Doing a review on the movie Blade (uhh)

the movie is rated R. 

(umm) It stars Wesley Snipes and Steven Dorff. 

(uhh) 

Blade is 

about 

vampires. 

(uhh) Blade is the, a vampire, he is a mixed breed he does have the 

(uhh) 

ability to be a daywalker, he is immortal as well as half man. 

(uhh) And the 

first movie (uhh) 

Blade, he (uhh) 

is sharpened his skills as far as being (uhh) 

a hunter. (uhh) 

But he's also trying to (uhh) 

go up against Deacon Frost which is (uhh) 

like the lord of the mortals. 

Now (uhh) they are trying to give Blade's blood so that they can 

unlock the archives, the ancient archives so that they can, the vampires can become daywalkers like Blade. 

But this is a action-packed movie and if you like vampires and action-packed and Wesley Snipes, recommend picking up Blade.
