Hello, expo. I'd like to tell you about a movie called The Hottie and the Nottie. This is a movie starring Paris Hilton. The only thing that really saves this movie is that Paris has her clothes on.

It's really a terrible, terrible movie and it shows that, once again, Paris has to be in front of the camera. She's very narcissistic in doing that because, after all the trouble she's been in and after all the terrible (uhh) X-rated that movies she's been in, I'm real, not even, I don't even understand why she would want to be in a movie. Why I went to see this? Actually it was a matinee, so I paid around five dollars to see it. Actually, it wasn't worth a dollar to see. I suppose I was just curious to see if she could redeem herself. She's not an actress. She. The story plot's lame. It's a silly really it (uhh). She's supposed to be the gorgeous girl that a school mate has had a  (stutter) long-time crush on. Her girlfriend is supposed to be (uhh) uglier than ugly and can't find a date. (uhh) Paris decides that she will not date anyone until she can find a date for her girlfriend, so she goes to all means to make her girlfriend

(uhh) accessible and that's basically is the plot of the story. We do see a lot of Paris, but thank goodness she has her clothes on. That's really the only good thing I can say about it. She should be ashamed for even showing xxx herself in the movies because, to me, she's not a pretty girl, with or without her clothing and this movie is not good at all.
