This DVD is entitled (uhh) Last to Surrender. It stars Roddy Piper, who a lot of you will remember Roddy Piper was a wrestler for many, many years. He has delved out into doing a few (uhh) movies from time to time. Obviously, it's going to be a B movie (uhh), cuase like I say, because he used to be a wrestler, so, but he stars in this movie.

(umm) He's got a partner. He's a cop. And they have a wild shootout and his (uhh) partner is killed. He vows to track down the killer. (uhh) He's only known by the name Tiger. So they really don't know much more than that, but, (umm) like I say, he goes through the movie trying to find out his partner's killer. And (uhh) if you like Roddy Piper, you'd probably like this movie. If you don't, you probably won't. 

But (uhh) doesn't really have any special features. It's just the movie itself. And it is a B movie. (umm) I found it to be, you know, and okay movie. But, you know, everybody can judge for themselves. Some people really like B movies. You know, they they (stutter) like them better than the (uhh) the (stutter) best blockbuster movies out there. So you might all just give it a chance and see what you think.
