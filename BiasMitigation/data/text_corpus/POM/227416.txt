Hello, today I'm reviewing the movie A Bronx Tale, starring Robert De Niro and (stutter) Chazz Palmintiri. (uhh) This movie is actually the directorial debut (uhh) by Robert De Niro. (umm) It's classic De Niro in the fact that it's kind of got a mafia overlay in everything that's going on. (uhh) Essentially Chazz Palmintiri is a crime boss and Robert De Niro is a bus driver, so you have two opposite sides of the tracks and in between these two gentlemen is Robert De Niro's son who is seeing the best of both worlds. (umm) He has his father that has everyone's respect because he earned it, but he has to work hard for it and he sees the crime boss who

has everybody's respect because they're all scared to death of him. (umm) So he gets to see both sides of the story and has to make a decision on which way he's gonna go with it. (umm) It's a very very good movie. (umm) One that kind of makes you think. (uhh) you can sit back, you can enjoy it and for a directorial debut it's definitely impressive on the side of Robert De Niro. (umm) A couple of bonus features, not a whole lot. (uhh) Just some cast bios, (uhh) it's dubbed in multiple language and (uhh) multiple languages and (uhh) it has the original theater trailer. (uhh) So nothing big there, just a couple of things. But definitely one that you want to add to your collection, especially if you are a gangster (uhh) movie fan. This one's gonna pull five out of five stars for me.
