Hi, everyone. Today I'm going to do my Expo review on this DVD movie called Final Fantasy seven. (umm) This is the two-disc special edition. So it has the movie and then it has other scenes, clips, and other games or whatever on the second disc.

It came out a a (stutter) year or two after the the (stutter) Playstation game that was Final Fantasy seven, which was a great game. This DVD, however, sucks. I really didn't like it. It was all basically, it's basically the game, but you just get to watch all the scenes in a movie form. (umm) And it makes Cloud, the main character, look like a real big, like, sissy or something. He doesn't look very (umm) heroic, like I thought he would have been in the game. 

So I didn't really like this DVD, a waste of fifteen dollars. You could probably get it for under five dollars now, since it's so old and so bad. (umm) I definitely don't suggest this to anyone who's played the video game, because it will ruin the game for you. 

And it's called Final Fantasy seven. Thanks.
