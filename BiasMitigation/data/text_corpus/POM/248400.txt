Hi. Today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

The Last Crusade was supposed to be, of course, the final adventure of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. That's no longer true since the fourth film is being released this summer. Nevertheless, the Last Crusade returns to the original sense of magic and fun that you found in Raiders of the Lost Ark, magic that was lost somewhat during Temple of Doom. (uhh) maybe it's because the Nazis return as the primary villains of the story, or maybe it's because of the return of greater supporting characters like Sallah and Doctor Marcus Brody. (umm)

The Last Crusade also introduces River Phoenix as the young Indiana Jones who begins his archaeological career at thirteen (uhh) and finds his first use of the bullwhip and his trademark Fedora. Also joining the cast is Sean Connery who is fantastic as Professor Henry Jones, father of Indiana. The chemistry that the two have as father and son is remarkable and you really come away believing that Connery was only about twelve years older than Harrison Ford, is the father who was almost never there. The plot of the film finds Indiana Jones recruited by an American businessman who is trying to find the legendary Holy Grail. The businessman has already recruited Jones' father who has disappeared in the quest. Jones agrees and so begins the great adventure. The movie xxx the magic and fond of Raiders of the Lost Ark and is a great return to form for the film series. I give the movie itself five out of five stars. And the DVD contains no special features since it was released as part of The Adventures of Indiana Jones Collection which has an entire disc of bonus features.
