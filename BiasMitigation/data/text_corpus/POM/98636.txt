Hi I'm reviewing (uhh)

Retroactive. It's a sci-fi thriller starring James Belushi and Kylie Travis. (umm)

(uhh) James Belushi plays a (uhh) psychopath who kind of takes her hostage and (uhh) commits a few murders and they're out in the middle of the desert and somehow they end up at a research center and there's a guy there who basically has a time machine and he gives her a chance to go back and prevent

it from happening. (umm)

Really if, if (stutter) he had a time machine there seem to be better things that could be done with it than (uhh), well anyway. The movie's kind of silly. It stars James Belushi as like (uhh) a psychotic killer (uhh) which is kind of silly. (umm)

The whole thing's actually pretty silly. (uhh) There's no real special features on here except for the trailer. (uhh) It is widescreen but it really doesn't matter because the movie's not worth watching.
