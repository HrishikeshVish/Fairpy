Hello expotv land. It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you today about the movie currently in theaters Meet the Spartans. And I don't know (stutter) why I did, but I went to this movie cause I knew I would hate it, cause I hate all movies like this. Like exactly what the Scary Movies have become, the last three-hundred they made, and

things like The Comebacks. They're just all these lame attempts that just keep on referencing movies over and over and they're just not even funny. Like, they just have, I just don't know how they come up with them, they're not funny. Meet the Spartans was just the same way. (umm) They're talking about the Three-Hundred and really they just keep on bringing up things that aren't funny. They're all trying to make this topical humor like Britney Spears, just all this ridiculous stuff that doesn't make sense and isn't, just not funny. I don't know why they keep on making these kinds movie and

I just hope they don't make more movies like this, cause

Three-Hundred just came out last year and they already made a parody of it. I just don't know. These people seem to not have anything else to do with their time. I just don't like it and I hope they don't keep on making more like this.

Don't watch Meet the Spartans.
