This is Dracula. 

This is (uhh) a DVD movie. And 

it's basically about (uhh), it's about Dracula and (uhh) 

he goes around killing people and sucking the blood. That kind of thing.

I never really liked this film that much. (uhh)

it didn't interest me that much. 

But (uhh) it does have notable actors and it has Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves.

(uhh) 

This is, it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola.

But, like I said, I never liked it that much.
 
(uhh) it's a super good movie.

(uhh) the only super good movie I have which is kind of weird. 

It has a couple special features. 

There's wide screen, there's subtitles (uhh)

you know, 

nothing that, that (stutter) great, but

Yeah, it's interesting to watch.

(umm)

There's a few (uhh), there's really a couple interesting parts I liked in the movie but overall I didn't like it that much. And (uhh) 

I'd say I'd give it a two out of five.
