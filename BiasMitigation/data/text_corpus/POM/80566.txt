This is a box set of the original three Star 

Wars movies. 

A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi. 

They are referenced countlessly 

in you know, modern culture, modern cinema. You see references you know 

Luke I am your father but with somebody else's name. And 

they are almost an American icon. 

These are the movies that 

you know, were in the 

late seventies or early eighties before the yuppies existed before George Lucas 

had the money to 

and the technology to 

remove everything 

but the actors. 

I I (stutter) mean in the original Star Wars, people actually acted it. 

It's it's (stutter) a good set of movies because the story it tells is quite good, (uhh) 

it's got good acting it's it's (stutter) one of those 

things that are original, that are icons of America and American cinema, 

like The Godfather or. 

It you can name these movies that are historically you know 

referenced and you know everpresent in our society and Star Wars is one of them and 

this does it justice. 

(uhh) I think it deserves five out of five stars, I would buy it again if I didn't already have it.
