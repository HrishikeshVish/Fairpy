Hi, I'm here to do a review on The Scorpion King starring, The Rock.

This movie's rated PG-thirteen

It's about a, Cadian dude, or whatever. That's like the last of his kind.

And he's going, and he's a mercenary assassin, back in like a long long time ago

and he's supposed to like, kill these people

but he ends up, he can't 

and his two brothers die, so he's going after this king warlord kind of guy

and his whole purpose is to kill this sorceress girl right here

but he can't, he ends up falling in love with her

and she goes with him, 

well he kidnapped her, and he ends up meeting up with like the rebels which is that dude right there, the leader 

and, they like, end up stopping this evil warlord guy

so, that's why I recommend watching the Scorpion King.
