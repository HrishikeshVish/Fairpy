This is a review for the

movie 

Meltdown 

Days of Destruction starring Casper Van Dien. Meltdown Day of Destruction 

is a movie with fine setting. The new releases 

section at Blockbuster xxx directed the DVD movie. You know you're not going to get anything good when you rent it but, 

it is starring I guess, nineteen ninety-eight xxx 

Casper Van Dien 

which I would say is only one of the good things about this film that is if you appreciate Casper Van Dien's acting at all and by acting I mean 

his ability to portray Casper Van Dien. But anyway, 

this film, the (stutter) plot primary consist of Caster Van Dien, like, good cop who 

gets stuck in a really, really terrible situation i.e. you know, 

the xxx destruction of the world and 

with his 

dysfunctional family he tries to make an escape towards the Arctic. 

I'm not kidding, that's the (uhh) plot of this film. 

One of the {sigh} 

lacking aspects of this feature 

along with 

zero nudity, 

zero violence, 

zero vulgarity, 

zero suspense, 

terrible acting, 

terrible dialogue, 

mutants mutants (stutter) show up, they never explained how there are mutants I guess, the radiation from the sun or something like that xxx that's not important. 

What's important is that you should never rent this film unless you have a depreciation in general for films which in that case,

go right ahead cause this is a terrible film. 

Compared to other classic starring Casper Van Dien like Python or Tarzan, 

this is, this is simply not 

meet the expectation. 

As for rating a 

quantification, I would it's about a 

one point five out of five stars and I don't know why I'm being so generous today but for whatever reason I am. But (umm) 

so if you like horrible movies, 

you have a secret crush on Casper Van Dien that you didn't get over in the nineties, 

please rent Meltdown

Days of Destruction.
