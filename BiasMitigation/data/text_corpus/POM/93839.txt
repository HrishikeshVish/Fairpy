Hi {sigh}. Tonight I'm going to be reviewing a terrible movie called

Killer Klowns From Outer Space. Now this is pretty much, 

I mean it's released by MGM but it was a very independent sort of movie. It was made by Orion Pictures Corporation. It's very short, only eighty-six minutes long. It's rated PG-thirteen and it is about killer clowns who 

are from outer space and they land in a field near a small town and they proceed to take, 

take (stutter) over. And the movie also follows a group of teenagers who set out to destroy the clowns and reclaim what's rightfully theirs, their hometown. 

But, I mean, as you can probably expect with a movie titled Killer Klowns From Outer Space the movie is 

just full of terrible acting and bad cinematography.

It's a fun concept but they just didn't really pull it off that well. So that I would just, I would give it a two out of five. It has some funny moments but overall it's just not that great. So (uhh)

if someone gives you the DVD watch it, but I wouldn't spend any money on it like I did. This was kind of a waste of money. That's all I have to say about that.
