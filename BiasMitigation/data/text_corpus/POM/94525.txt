Hey. (umm) This is a review of Live Free or Die Hard, 

which is

actually just opened in theaters and is still currently there and I'm sure will do very good this weekend because it is

an amazing movie. (uhh) Being a fan of the original Die Hard and sequels (umm) I was glad to see that it stayed true to the Die Hard roots. It (uhh) had great action, featured real stunts which was a good change

from current movies. (umm)

It had a good story, had a great villain. (umm)

Pretty much everything you expect from Die Hard it delivered. 

It's an amazing movie, you need to go see it. The only negative that I could think of was there was no Carl Winslow, 

Sergeant Al Powell, which was a little disappointing but (uhh) I can look past that to see this great movie for what it is.

(umm) Don't be bothered by the PG-thirteen. It (uhh)

besides cussing it has everything else, well I mean it has cussing but just not to the extent that the original Die Hard did, but

it's still a great movie. Five out of five.
