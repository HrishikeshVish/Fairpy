Hey expo. What's up? (umm) Today I'm going to talk about a movie I saw called Valkyrie,

starring Tom Cruise.

(umm) Valkyrie was a bad movie.

First of all Valkyrie is about

a plot to assassinate Hitler before all hell breaks loose in Germany.

Now most of us are pretty familiar with the history of World War Two but we know that Hitler killed himself

so this is the first movie I ever went into knowing the ending. Now some people would say that that's important but it is when they're trying to create suspense around it.

Another thing that I didn't like about it was the fact that it starred Tom Cruise. Not just cause he's a nutjob, but because he really did not convince me. It wasn't

a German soldier trying to overthrow Hitler, it was Tom Cruise pretending to be an (stutter), pretending to be a German soldier overthrowing Hitler and we saw through that. He didn't even try, he didn't even attempt a German accent.

He can do an Irish accent in Far and Away, I don't understand why he couldn't do a German accent in this.

Also

I went into this movie expecting at least a little bit of action considering the fact that it, it's (stutter) surrounded by a war

and, you know, violence. However there was none whatsoever. There was maybe three gunshots in the entire thing and I think they all missed. Maybe one hit. And that was it, it was over. They caught him, the end. Sorry if I ruined it for you but you really shouldn't be seeing it anyway. So

don't waste your time, go see something better. Something funny that will make you laugh, like Yes Man.
