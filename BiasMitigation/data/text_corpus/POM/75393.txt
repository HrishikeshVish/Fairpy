Hello, I'm Sean and I'm here to tell you about the movie Hot Fuzz.

(umm) I went to go see this in theaters. It is a hilarious movie. It is made by the stars, a lot of the same people, that were in Shawn of the Dead.

(umm) The premise of this movie is one of the characters is a constable in London and he has the highest ratings out of any of the police force in London and he's really cracking down on crime.

He's making everyone else look bad in the London police force, so they send him off to a small village to boost the London police force numbers so he won't be making everyone else look bad. 

He gets sent to this small village, which at first he absolutely despises 

and (uhh) it is a very quaint little village

(uhh) and it's one village of the year several times. (uhh) But this village has one of the highest accident rates that you've ever, that you've ever (stutter) heard of,

especially in Great Britain (uhh)

and he goes on to start investigating all these accidents and that's the premise of the movie. It was a hilarious movie. The last twenty to thirty minutes of the movie I had a huge smile on my face. It just made me giggle like a little girl.

(umm) But anyways, it's a it's a (stutter) great movie, you should definitely check it out.
