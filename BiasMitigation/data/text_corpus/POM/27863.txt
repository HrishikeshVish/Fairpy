Hi. This is a movie called Memoirs of a Geisha and this is a really good movie. It's one (stutter) it (uhh) it had six Academy Award nominations 

and

(umm)

this is the story that takes place just before World War Two and goes through World War Two in Japan. And, you know, when I first heard the title of it I didn't think it would be a very good movie, but it turned out to be a really good movie. 

In fact I saw it twice on the big screen which I rarely see movies twice, 

even on the (stutter) big screen or DVD I just don't like to watch movies again, but this one I did. (uhh) The story's good, it's kind of a Cinderella story (umm) and (uhh) the (stutter) Cinderella story about a girl who grows up in 

(uhh), you know, kind of a bad part of town (stutter) in this town of Japan after being sold. Her parents have to sell her (uhh) they don't have to, they sold her and her sister, you know, I guess for medical, (uhh) to pay the medical bills of the mother who was dying, sick so it's kind of a family separation and then she goes into the bad part of town and

tells about her life. And this is a really good movie, I (stutter) it's got a good story line to it and most of all it's got really good photography. The photography in this thing is exceptional, which is one of the reasons I went back to see it. So I would rate this five out of five, no hesitation. You can get this movie on (stutter) at Amazon dot com for, you know, under fifteen dollars.
