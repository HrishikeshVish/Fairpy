Hey there, Summer here, and today I have another DVD review for you. The DVD is Casino. Now with Sharon Stone, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci this is a classic gangster, Las Vegas, casino movie. Now this movie is rated R, and it is truly not good for kids. The language in this one in this one is astronomical. But the storyline is very simple and gangster. The beginnings of Vegas, someone who's not supposed to run a casino gets put by the mob bosses in to run a casino and things go less than well in that situation. There's a lot drama, drug use, and some sexually explicit behavior, so like I said no kids allowed. But for adults who like gangster movies Casino's the one for you. I definitely give this five stars. The DVD is brought to you by Universal Pictures and it is a long movie. It's three hours long, so you're going to need to have some time on your hands to watch this one. But like I said if you like gangster movies like I do, and you'll watch just about anything Joe Pesci, then this is the movie for you. Casino gets five stars.
