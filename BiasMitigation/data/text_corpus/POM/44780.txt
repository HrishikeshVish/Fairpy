Hello there. My name is Adam and (uhh) right now I am going to review the movie called Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. 

(umm) This movie is directed by Ang Lee.

It was released (uhh) few years ago I guess now (umm) and (uhh) 

it's got (uhh) some interesting (uhh) special effects, a lot of (uhh) wired effects where people are flying around and that and (uhh) 

it was (uhh) as you can see in the front here, winner of four academy awards. It was very 

well reviewed and liked by the critics. (umm) The (uhh) DVD itself has a lot of special features on it. 

(uhh) It's got a lot of behind the scenes things and all that. 

(uhh) I will be perfectly honest though, (umm) I didn't really find this movie that interesting, I found it hard to follow what was going on, 

and (uhh) 

it just wasn't my cup of tea at all. (umm) I would probably give it maybe (uhh) 

at best a two out of five, (uhh) you know, because it's (uhh) 

international film, you know, (stutter) so give you a little bit of different culture (umm) which I get is, is (stutter) you know kinda interesting, but (uhh) 

I (uhh) probably wouldn't recommend people going to see this. It's (uhh) 

a renting. It's not, 

not (stutter) that great but,

anyways that's my opinion on Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.
