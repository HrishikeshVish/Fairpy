Hi. Today with me I have the video Lady (uhh) Disney's Lady and the Tramp Two Scamp's Adventure.

(umm) This is rated G and runs for about seventy minutes.

The impeccable pedigree of Disney's beloved classic Lady and the Tramp comes in an all new story, Lady and the Tramp Two Scamp's Adventure. Told with the same stunning animation, charming musical style, and purebred fun. 

Along with their well behaved girl puppies Lady and the Tramp are busy raising mischievous 

Scamp who's always in the doghouse. Longing for freedom, Scamp ventures far from home and meets a lovely, reluctant stray named Angel.

She introduces him to the junkyard dogs led by streetwise Buster. When Buster challenges Scamp to the ultimate test of a carefree life Scamp finds himself torn between a world of adventure and love for the family he's left behind. All new music and star studded voice talent leaded by Scott Wolf and Alyssa Milano

(umm) makes this irresistible, heart warming tale a whole new breed of Disney magic.

I highly recommend this movie, it's so (umm)

cute. It's really touching {laugh} and (umm) I got this at Target for about (umm) 

twelve dollars. 

I highly recommend this.
