Hi. This movie (umm) review is about 

the two-thousand seven movie called Allegro. 

(umm) It's basically kind of confusing movie

and if I had to give it a grade, it would probably be like (uhh) a scale on one to ten it would probably be a five or a six. 

(umm) The piano playing in the film music were pretty much exciting 

(umm) and excellent.

(umm) This story is really complicated to follow. 

(umm) 

It was just hard to go along with the whole movie because 

(umm) because of the fantasy portion 

it was it was (stutter) related to the zone 

and (uhh) basically some people like me cannot follow it, and 

it was just kind of boring and confusing. (umm)

I don't know it was basically not a movie from mainstream

and (uhh) basically it was just kind of a really confusing and boring movie like I said and it's not worth paying your money for 

in 

my 

opinion if it's even out in your theaters. It's really not a great movie. Go see 

(umm) that's why I give it a five or a four.
