Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns. As a formality here's the movie ticket.

Here

and here's the movie ticket sideways, that's not a formality that's just for fun.

Alright, now if you've seen any of the other Tyler Perry movies this is exactly like it, so if you like those, you'll like this.

It's too much for me at this point if I see another Tyler Perry movie I'm never gonna go see it. The only one saving grace for this movie was Medea. Medea's always hilarious. I I (stutter) don't know why but Tyler Perry dressed up as a large, tall woman

makes me laugh.

Don't know about you, but it does me. Now this movie is yeah, as I said, exactly the same as the other ones, it's like a love family type story. (uhh) Way too many stereotypes, I I wanna (stutter) I wouldn't recommend this movie. Not one bit. I would just wait for it to come out on a network television when it gets replayed three times for a weekend and then every other weekend for the rest of its life.

So no, please don't go see this movie it's horrible.

Unless you like the others then go see this, otherwise wait. Thank you, have a good day.
