The movie I'm reviewing is The Ex, and it's in movie theaters now and it stars (umm) Zach Braff and Amanda Peet. And basically it's just (umm) the two of them are husband and wife and the story's just about (umm) him losing his job and they go to live with her parents and then he works for her dad. And (umm) 

The one guy that he works with was involved with Amanda Peet (umm) before, and so he's the ex. (umm)

But it's supposed to be a comedy and it really wasn't all that funny. (umm) 

I had somebody when I watched the movie (umm) near us who was just laughing obnoxiously at everything so that also kind of made it a little weird. But (umm) it just like I said it wasn't really too funny and the story line wasn't really all that great either. so (umm) if you're looking to just go see any kind of movie, (umm) you could go see it but it's not one I would really recommend. And I probably wouldn't recommend (uhh) renting it either when it comes out on DVD so. It's The Ex and I would probably give it about a five out of ten.
