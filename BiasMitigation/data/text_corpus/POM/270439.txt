This is The Bourne Supremacy. It's the second part of the three part series, which is (uhh) one of my favorite action movies with a lot of suspense and drama. (umm) This is actually my least favorite of the three part series. (umm) A lot of action and everything was really good in it.

As (uhh) as part of the series, I didn't think it held up to the rest of the series. The first entry and the last entry were really well written and a lot of action and a lot of suspense. This one is kind of (uhh)

just moving you along and progressing it and it's not as fast paced as the other ones. Which being that it's an action movie, I felt like it was kind of a little sub par. Slowed down a little too much. (umm) It's still a fantastic movie compared to other action movies but probably my least favorite out of the three part series.
