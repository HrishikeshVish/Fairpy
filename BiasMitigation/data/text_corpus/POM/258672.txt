Hi I'm reviewing the movie in theaters, Step Up Two the Streets. This is a sequel to the earlier dance movie Step Up. And this is a dance movie as well. It has (uhh) a decent-ish plot, basically it has (uhh) a street dancer so to speak, who's a part of a kind of gang of dancers. It's kind of odd honestly, this whole like street coupled with dance situation. (uhh) But she decides that she doesn't just wanna be a street dancer she wants to go to the elite Maryland School of the Arts. So she manages to get in there and she gets together with this other fellow who is sent over there who is like the lead dancer in the school and they start their own little thing. But there's a lot of rivalry between like the street gang and the school gang and at one point one of them is actually beaten up.

So this basically for anyone who's gonna go watch this movie, if you're really into like dance movies and you like watching dancing it could be decent for that. Plotwise it's honestly kind of weak, has a little bit of racist overtones as well. So it's not a great movie but again if you like watching the dancing it could be for you. Bye.
