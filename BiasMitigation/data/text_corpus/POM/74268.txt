This is a cute movie, it's the the (stutter) remake of the cartoon How the Grinch Stole Christmas you know long time ago. But (uhh) it's good for kids. But it's rated PG. If you'd like to find out more about this movie you can go to grinched dot com, that's g r i n c h e d dot com. And you can find out. But it's got (uhh) this is a two disc (stutter) deluxe edition. Disc one is the collector's edition and it's got spotlight on location deleted scenes, outtakes, stuff like that. (uhh) It's got Max's playhouse, got sing along songs, read along, to care and feeding of the Grinch. And disc two is the (uhh) all new deluxe edition features include
