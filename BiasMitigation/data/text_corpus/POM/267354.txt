HI, I'm reviewing Azumi. This movie was amazing. Filled with action, and there was passion in it, it was great. Basically it it's (stutter) set in feudal Japan where ten homeless children are taken care of by an elderly man and they are trained to be assassins. However their first

(umm) their first

mission was to have to kill their  (umm) other parts of their clan, to see who was worthy of being assassins. Because then those other five are being sent out to kill three main people who are causing trouble in the world. There's a lot of action and the main character, she's amazing. She's a great fighter and this is definitely a movie that should be watched. It's in Japanese and in English and also has the option of having subtitles. So definitely Azumi would be a great movie to get.
