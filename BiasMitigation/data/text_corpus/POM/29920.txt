Hi my name is Roy Daley and this is the Groundhog Day special edition DVD 

(umm) with Bill Murray. It's the movie where he keeps reliving the same day over and over. 

(uhh) this is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite movie. 

(umm) It is (uhh) a great movie and this DVD is (umm) 

it's a great DVD. It's widescreen, the movie looks great, (umm) there (uhh) 

just like in the theaters and everything. 

(umm) has all the the the (stutter) digitally remastered and the dolby audio and everything. Special features are 

(umm) are good. 

I enjoyed them, there's audio commentary from the director. There's a (uhh) feature about the weight of time and how 

(uhh) the whole thing works, and how, you know how they got the concept of doing a movie like this and which is actually pretty interesting. 

(umm) some trailers and (uhh) some stuff like that. (umm) 

but mostly just the commentary and the documentary, that the feature about time and what not. So 

it's a great (stutter) DVD for a great movie. I love it and (uhh) 

(umm) it's a solid DVD. Again that's the special edition Groundhog Day DVD.
