Charlotte's Web.

(uhh) This is a cute little movie.

It is PG for all audiences. It's based on the book Charlotte's Web.

Of course it's got little special effects in it because all your little barnyard critters are talking to one another.

But it's just like the book. Wilbur the pig is (uhh) befriended by Charlotte the spider and (uhh) she promised him that she's gonna do whatever it takes to prevent him from being Christmas dinner. She wants him to see (uhh) his first snowball and

it's just

cute little movie. (umm)

There is a character in there that I think is a hoot. I'm not sure what his name is but he is the rat and he is funny and he's he's (stutter) also a big help when it comes to helping Charlotte choose the words that are needed to draw attention to Wilbur. So with Charlotte writing the words in the web and the farmer seeing those words and eventually they're able to save Wilbur and he makes it to that first snowfall and he makes it to Christmas.

But (uhh), it's a cute little movie, just like the book and 

(uhh) definitely would recommend it for all ages.

So, Charlotte's Web.
