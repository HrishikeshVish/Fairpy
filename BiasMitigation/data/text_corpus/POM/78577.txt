Directed by Ron Howard, Backdraft stars (uhh) Kurt Russel and William Baldwin as two Chicago Firefighters out to stop an arsonist.

(umm) Has a good strong supporting cast including Donald Sutherland and Robert De Niro. 

However, It's aged quite a bit and for a murder, thriller, drama starring firefighters it's not all that great of a movie. 

(umm) For one thing it has William Baldwin, one of the worst of the Baldwin brothers. (umm)

In it's some interesting use of fire, particularly the whole concept of back draft, which a lot of people don't really know about. (umm)

Starts in Chicago which is my favorite city, which gotta give props for that, that they don't use New York or Los Angeles. Go for something a little grittier, get the (uhh) audience. Of course it's filmed in the nineties otherwise they would've probably used New York for the firefighters.

(umm) The movie has very few (uhh) additional features on it. (umm) just captions and subtitles. It's widescreen, 

yes widescreen see. 

If you get this for five bucks, I guess it would be okay to get. 

(umm) It's really not worth watching though. 

Directed by Ron Howard and he does a good job usually, but not with this. This is a bad movie.
