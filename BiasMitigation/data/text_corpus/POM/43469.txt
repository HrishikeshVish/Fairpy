Do you know what the number is? 

Three hundred. It's three zero zero. Now 

let me tell you why three hundred's a good number. Three-hundred's a great number because

the Spartans

dominate in this movie. It

I 

I (stutter) heard plenty of things, I don't normally go to the movies, I go to the Lord of the Rings, big movies. So I wanted to see this one just because I'd heard so much about it, (umm) from friends. And they didn't ruin it for me, I mean, given if you already know the story

it's not ruining it for you. They die in the end, if you're familiar with the story so I'm not really ruining anything for you. (umm) It's based off the graphic, kind of like,

back in the day tales. But anyways

this movie blew me away. I am very into film, (uhh) I have a camera and, obviously I'm filming on it now it's right there. But I like to edit, and I have my own video editing business and this movie absolutely blew me away. (umm) If you are a man or

even if you're a woman like, 

like (stutter) I mean given it's mainly action, it's not much of a love story so much as like, you know, Titanic, {sigh} (umm)

I was so impressed, I was blown away and the entire night afterwards. I saw it in IMAX. Screen was six stories high by eighty feet and that's half a football field, and

it was crystal clear and I was absolutely in awe. I definitely recommend seeing, it if not in an IMAX, just anywhere. Please go see Three hundred. It's probably the best movie I've seen in a long time.

Have a good day.
