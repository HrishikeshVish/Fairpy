Hi. Today I'm going to be reviewing the movie Best Laid Plans. It stars Reese Witherspoon. (umm) Relationships can be murder. (umm) It's the special edition. (uhh) It's rated R and (umm) {mumble} one and a half hours long. 

(umm) The movie is about (umm) a guy (umm) who (umm) owes some money and (umm) he (umm) ends up robbing and it go, ends up being bad. (umm) And so he's left (umm) owing this guy money in, like, 48 hours or he's going to die. And since his robbery went bad (umm) he takes what the movie says, desperate measures to (umm) well, undertakes drastic measures to get his hands on some fast cash.

But (umm) he works with his girlfriend, who is Reese Witherspoon (umm) to (umm) get some cash quick to pay of his (umm) debt. (umm) It has some bonus features (umm) some deleted scenes, alternate endings, cast and crew bios, and other stuff like that.

(umm) But as for the movie itself, (umm) I didn't really care for it. (umm) My husband liked it, but (umm) I thought it was pretty boring. (umm) That's it. I just didn't care for it. It's kind of like a, it's a (stutter) drama movie, action. And usually I like Reese Witherspoon movie so I don't know what happened with this one but I didn't really like it so.
