Hi. This is Dan with my review of Groundhog Day by (stutter) Bill Murray. This is one of my favorite movies. So I would give this a (stutter) enthusiastic five out of five rating. (umm) Groundhog Day is rated PG for (umm) some suggestive scenes and materials, but this is a very funny movie in that it is well-played by Bill Murray and well-written (umm) by far. Groundhog Day (umm) being (ahh) that day in spring in which the groundhog comes out of its hibernation, checks and looks for its shadow. And if he sees it, then we have X more weeks of winter left, something like that.

(umm) Billy Murray and his crew, his news crew, are sent to cover (umm) the (umm) emergence of Punxsutawney Phil, yup, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, (uhh) the (stutter) groundhog famous for coming out and looking for its shadow. But what Bill Murray finds out is that he is somehow trapped in this day. He wakes up. He replays the day over, as if nothing the day before had happened. And, you know, he lives this day over and over and over again. At first, he enjoys it, from robbing banks to doing whatever he wishes, (uhh) until he finally realizes that he's stuck in this little timewarp and even tries to drive off a cliff to kill himself, only to wake up to that same alarm that's been going off day after day after day. The mystery is how he is going to break out of this loop, and that's the fun of the movie. 

Groundhog Day is a fun one, good for dates, good for significant others. It's, to some degree, a chick flick (uhh) which is, which is (stutter) fun. But you'll also get a good laugh out of it (umm) in addition to the romance and the drama that does evolve in it.

This is Dan and my hearty recommendation of Groundhog Day as a movie not to be missed.
