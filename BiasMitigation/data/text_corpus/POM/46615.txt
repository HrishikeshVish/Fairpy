Hi I'm reviewing 

Postmortem. 

Starring (uhh) 

Charlie Sheen 

(umm) 

I guess now he's trying to take himself seriously since the box says, 

Charles Sheen, 

but (uhh) 

this is not a movie I would pick 

if I was 

Charles Sheen 

to launch my serious movie career. 

(uhh) 

In the movie he plays 

a (uhh) serial killer profiler. 

Which there are a million of in movies. 

And he retires to become a novelist but he moves to a small town 

to get away from it all and it turns out that the small town has a serial killer so he has to 

help track him down. (uhh) 

It's 

not (uhh) 

a very good movie. 

I didn't enjoy watching it, 

there's no special features. 

(uhh) So it's a pretty poor DVD. 

(uhh) 

Overall 

I really can't say anything positive about this, I wouldn't recommend watching it. 

(uhh) I actually think it went straight to DVD. 

So if you see it 

on the shelf, just go ahead and avoid it.
