Hi. I'm here to talk about the movie Halloween two (uhh) that just came out a couple days ago. It's a Rob Zombie movie, a continuation of Halloween one, which was in theaters a few years ago. (umm) It starts off (uhh) a year after Laurie kills (stutter) Michael, or thinks she kills Michael. And it's the next Halloween after. And in this movie, you kind of see that, you know, no, he hasn't actually died and he's still looking for her. And it's kind of a journey into her own madness, like, her own insanity. You see her kind of, her life obviously unraveled since the brutal murders of almost everybody in her life and the attempted murder of herself. And it just gets more brutal and more brutal as he keeps trying to catch up with her and find her and make his family complete because his mother is (uhh) trying to make him complete the family. And (umm) it's one of the most brutal horror movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I don't even remember what the body count was. It was so violent, so scary. And I'm not someone who is scared by movies easily. Like, there are lots of flashback scenes, lots of dream sequences. It was beautifully done. (umm) It's a great continuation of the first movie. (umm) The ending is totally frightening. It's it's (stutter)  amazing. I can't, I'm a huge horror movie fan, and I really thought this was true to the original Halloween movies. And just so scary. And the graphics are so realistic. (umm) But, yeah, it's amazing and it is really frightening. So if you want a good scare, (umm) I would recommend this movie, but not if you have a sensitive stomach. So go see Halloween two.
