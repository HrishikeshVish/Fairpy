Hi (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is a movie. It's a dvd and it's called Junior that stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito and I believe Emma Thompson as well.

And it's a movie about (umm)

Danny Devito and Arnold Schwarzenegger play scientists as well as Emma Thompson plays scientist as well.

And Danny Devito's also a gynecologist or obstetrician. He's an obstetrician and a scientist and he's working with Arnold Schwarzenegger to create some sort of (umm) drug that will help women

who are infertile to

you know,

get pregnant and

keep the pregnancy without you know, miscarrying or anything bad.

And their drug (umm) fails the FDA approval and so Danny Devito comes up with this brilliant idea of testing it out on Arnold Schwarzenegger. So basically the story (umm) line is that Arnold Schwarzenegger gets pregnant. As he's trying to test the drug and all the funny things that happen to him while he's testing out this drug called expecting. But it's a cute movie about a hour

and a half maybe an hour and a half to two hours.

And (umm) you can find this at any local (uhh) Walmart or Target even on Amazon dot com or deep dvd discounts

for under twenty dollars.
