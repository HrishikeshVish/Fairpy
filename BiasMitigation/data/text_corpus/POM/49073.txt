Hello and today I'm going to be reviewing the DVD Serenity.

And (uhh) this is "a triumph, a thrillingly original science fiction creation."

So, this is a science fiction DVD. So, it's all, it's for like science fiction lovers, obviously.

And (uhh) this takes place in the future and on a space ship, where six rebels are on the run because they have taken in a fugitive.

And this is like, they're sort of trying to protect her from (uhh) the relentless totalitarian regime that wants to get her back.

And (umm) how they were trying to help her escape.

And (uhh) this is a great movie that actually is from the same (uhh) person who did TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

So, there's a lot of explosive battles, a lot of special effects. It's really fantastic. There's a lot of new worlds. It's a really a great adventure. I recommend it for anyone.

(umm) It's rated PG thirteen, so it's mostly for teenagers and adults. Little kids probably won't be able to enjoy this so much,

but for (umm) teenagers and adults this is definitely a great movie.

A lot of action, a lot goes on. A lot of adventure. If you love sci-fi you'll probably, definitely love this movie.

And this is a widescreen edition, so a lot of TVs nowadays are widescreen, so having this be a widescreen edition is definitely helpful.

Once again this is the DVD Serenity. I highly recommend this movie. If you're bored or it's a rainy day or, you know, if you just want to watch a movie.
