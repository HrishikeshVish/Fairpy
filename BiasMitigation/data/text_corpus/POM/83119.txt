This is Entrapment, and it stars, (umm) Sean Connery and Katherine Zeta-Jones.  

This is the full-screen edition, (umm), it is rated PG-thirteen for (umm) probably some language and the action, 

but (umm) it is about, this guy who is kind of this thief and when a (uhh) priceless Rembrandt is stolen in New York

(umm) Katherine works for this insurance company and she is the investigator, so she kind of teams up secretly with (umm) the thief

to try to, you know, I guess, you know, catch him and he doesn't know who she really is, 

but she does, and so, they work together trying to find and, like, steal this next piece of art that is worth millions of dollars.

(umm) And it's a good movie.  It's really intense (umm) You have to follow it pretty closely, but it's good. 

It's full of action and I mean, it has some bonus features also so that's always good but yeah, I recommend it.
