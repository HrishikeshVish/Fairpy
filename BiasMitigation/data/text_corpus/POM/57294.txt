Hi, (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is called

Mister and Misses Smith. 

And this story in or, the movie sorry {laugh} 

(uhh) some of the actors that play are Carol Lombard and Robert Montgomery. 

And this dvd is about (umm) 

a couple who are married 

and (uhh) 

come to find out

that there was something wrong with 

the marriage license in the town where they got married.

(umm) Something about their marriage wasn't legal,

and it, 

it's about how (umm) 

they separate. 

And (umm)

he,

Mister Smith is trying to win his 

wife's 

affection again and try to get remarried, it. 

It's funnier than {laugh} what I'm saying, it really is. (umm) I'm not sure how best to describe it, but it's a hilarious movie. This is 

(uhh) probably the nineteen forties or ninteen fifties version. 

I believe there was an earlier version with Cary Grant (umm). 

And it, this one is in color 

and it's a great movie for people who love old classics and comedy classics. 

You can find this on amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.
