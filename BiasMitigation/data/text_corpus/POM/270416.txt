I just returned from the movies.

If you want to waste your time go see one called The Love Guru. That's G U R U. Guru, okay? Has Ben Kingsley in it. It's got Mike Myers, he's the, the (stutter) main character. (uhh) Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simson. Simpson. It's got a few others in there (uhh) that you will probably have heard about and usually when a movie has a lot of different people in it

that you know about it's usually not gonna be very good and this one wasn't. Mike Myers is absolutely awful. He (stutter) co-wrote this movie from what I understand and it's just, it's just absolutely horrid. The best thing about the movie was that it's only eighty-seven minutes long so you don't have to endure too much.

It's supposed to be a comedy but you'll go in there and you'll be waiting to laugh

but you never will, and then it'll be time to go. So I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. I'd say (stutter) there's much more movies out there that are (uhh) so much more better than this. So

that's my opinion.
