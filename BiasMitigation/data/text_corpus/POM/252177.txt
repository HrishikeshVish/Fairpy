Hi expotv land. It's me, Danny Ericson, and I'm here to talk to you about this great new movie called The Hottie and the Nottie, starring Paris Hilton

and (uhh) Joel Moore. (umm) This is just a great movie. (umm) Just had great themes in it. I (umm) it's about this guy called Nate who is (umm)

Who is (uhh) who has liked this girl since he was a little boy and he's had a lot of other girlfriends but he's finally realized that Paris Hilton is the one for him. So he tracks her down but realizes that there's this girl that's really ugly that (umm)

(stutter) that Paris Hilton's always hanging out with and that she won't go on a date without her friend who's ugly but then he (stutter) then so he's trying to find all these guys to go on dates with her. But (uhh) it turns out it's one of the best movies of the year and I would say definitely go and watch it if you're planning on having the worst time of your life. Paris Hilton in a movie? Please, come on. This is not a good movie. I don't think you should watch it. One out of ten, if that.

I'm sorry Paris Hilton but you really can't make movies.
