This is Children of Men the HD-DVD combo disc. Now this just came out 

and in fact is actually very difficult to find in most stores. (umm) 

Only my Best Buy had it in stock. 

Target and a whole bunch of other places including Amazon for some reason are having problems with the supply I'm not sure if it was just (uhh) a limited release 

or whatever but it seems to be very, very popular with good reason, cuz this was an excellent film. 

It's heavily stylized, it's set in the future. And the future (umm) 

the story or the basic premise of it anyways is that for some reason, people stopped having children and no one's sure why and 

no one's had any children for I don't if it was fifteen, eighteen, whatever years. And children of men, 

well I'm not gonna go into the story any more than that, but it's just an excellent film. 

Including some stunning sequences that just look absolutely beautiful in high def. There's one sequence that's an action sequence with the military attacking an apartment building 

that's almost a four minute long shot with no cuts, and it goes everywhere around the building and it's just very, very impressive. 

So (umm) 

the supplements are all right I wouldn't (uhh) nothing to write home about, really. 

And yes so the video quality, the audio quality's excellent. The supplements could be a little better 

but this movie is so good that doesn't even, that shouldn't even really matter. I'm going to give Children of Men the HD-DVD a solid five out of five.
