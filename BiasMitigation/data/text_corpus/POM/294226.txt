Hey y'all. It's the king of movies here and today I'm going to review Dragonball: Evolution. Now this is a new movie. It's a live-action and it's based off of Akira Toriyama's manga and anime (umm) that's incredibly popular. You might have seen the anime on Cartoon Network. (uhh) This movie is a lot different than that though and I think that was a bad thing overall. The movie lacks a charm that we've seen in the cartoon and the comics.

(umm) There's some bad martial arts, the effects are bad, there's overdubbing, which is terrible. (umm) The movie just overall has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. (uhh) The only thing that you can really do with this movie is just laugh at how bad it is, especially if you're a fan of the original works. (uhh) You're either gonna wanna stay away from this cause it cause it (stutter) might ruin your view of the Dragonball universe or (uhh) just (uhh) be willing to laugh at it and which you might get some entertainment out of it but that doesn't make it a good movie.

So, besides (umm) the bad martial arts and stuff like that, this movie is, it's possible that some kids might enjoy it. But for anyone older than ten I think that you'd wanna stay away. There's tons of plot holes and the movie just doesn't take itself seriously or it it (stutter) tries to but it just fails and (uhh) we're just left with a movie that really just has no backbone or any point. That's my review of Dragonball: Evolution. Stay away.
