Today I'm reviewing Snakes On A Plane. 

(uhh) 

Pretty funny movie, (uhh) pretty corny movie actually. (umm) I'm very surprised that a actor notorious as Samuel L. Jackson would agree to do a movie quite like this. 

(uhh) I guess you know money's money so if you get paid for this movie you get paid for something else and you don't really have to try to act too hard in this movie. 

(uhh) Basically starts out, 

a guy witnesses a murder. Samuel L. Jackson's an FBI agent, gonna protect him. 

(uhh) And then they get on a plane and 

the (uhh) the mobsters try to put snakes on a plane to kill everybody. 

Is basically how the movie you know, starts out. 

(uhh) Personally 

I thought it was pretty (uhh) 

it was just really corny, and I mean it's kind of interesting to see what they could possibly do with snakes on a plane. 

(uhh) I could see like maybe like attack eagles on a plane, because you know, eagles fly and planes fly but like snakes on planes you just, 

it's a concept that's really out there. 

(uhh) And then the snakes, it's just, it's kind of a more low budget film, the CG snakes, computer generated so they're not very realistic. 

(uhh) I wouldn't really recommend wasting money on this (uhh) if you have it and you wanna rent it or a friend owns it you wanna borrow it and that would be cool but don't go buy this.
