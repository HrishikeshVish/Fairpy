Hey expotv land, it's me Danny Ericson.

And I am here with some sad news. That I watched the movie

Over My Dead Body starring

(umm) Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd. (umm) Actually Paul Rudd was the only semi redeeming part of the movie I thought. He was, he was (stutter) actually pretty funny for what he did, even though the movie as a whole was really disappointing and not actually funny at all. (umm) I just really couldn't get over, well, about Eva Longoria. And she's this bride to be that gets killed on her wedding day by a falling ice statue and

it's just kind of hard to watch cause it's just like such a weird subject because she comes back to haunt him while he sees a psychologist, or (stutter) a specialist about getting over his wife. It's just like cheesy and stuff.

Kind of a gross subject to even have a premise on, so I just didn't like it. Just wasn't really funny.

It just kind of made me feel gross that I was even watching it. (stutter) Cause it's PG-thirteen but it's just

not great. So I wouldn't suggest watching it. If you have a choice between watching Over Her Dead Body and not watching Over Her Dead Body I would say

I would not watch Over Her Dead Body. So I'll leave you with that.
