HI, this is the DVD Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii and I picked this up for about, I think eight or nine dollars over at Best Buy and

I didn't really know exactly what was going on with this DVD but I checked it out and I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually really interesting. It has mostly, they play at Pompeii in the old coliseum

(umm) but no one's there. It's just kind of them. And then you also see kind of behind the scenes. You can see them working on Dark Side of the Moon album, which was really cool. 

(umm) Inside it just comes with this one little booklet. It just kind of has some pictures and stuff. 

(umm) But the DVD itself, it's not that long, but it's definitely interesting if you like Pink Floyd. It's not 

(uhh) really a concert video. But (stutter) it has enough tracks on it, that if you're looking for live performances, it definitely has that. Most of the songs on it are from before the Dark Side of the Moon. But there are a couple such as "Us and Them" and 

(uhh) "Brain Damage" on there that are from that album. 

So, if you like Pink Floyd, this is a really cool DVD. Thank you.
