I'd like to tell you about the movie Blade, starring Wesley Snipes. It is 

(uhh) based off a Marvel comic in which a half vampire, Blade, combats the forces of evil.

This DVD is the widescreen version. 

(uhh) It has a couple features on it, particularly the story line development, the technology development.

(uhh) Actually as far as comic book movies go I find this is a pretty good one. Not many ones are (uhh) better than this besides the X-Men one. 

(umm) It's produced by New Line Cinemas. It's rated R. It's very violent. A lot of swearing, gruesome, (uhh) gore, dismemberment, stuff like that. 

DVD is a one of these terrible cardboard cases. 

I don't like that. And then the, like the chapter names right here give away a lot of the story. It's a comic book so no big twists.

(umm) It's an older DVD so it has stuff like the  (uhh) complete theatrical trailer.

But (uhh) oh look, Kris Kristofferson is in it as Whistler, who's a very cool kind of

(umm) grizzly old man mentor.

It's a good movie, maybe three out of five. One of the better comic book movies. You can get this cheap 

(uhh) I'd (stutter) consider it. You can probably get this in a trilogy set with the other ones but the other ones are terrible compared to this.

So (uhh) go for it.
