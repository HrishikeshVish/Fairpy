Hello, I'm Matthew and I'm here to give you a DVD review of James Patterson's Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. James Patterson wrote the book under the same title. And this is my girlfriend's favorite book so she had to run out and get the movie. (umm) This was made for tv (umm) in two thousand five I think I'm not exactly sure. But it stars Christina Applegate and the good thing about this movie is it follows the book almost identical if you're a big fan of the book you're gonna love this movie.

The acting was very well done and it was pretty well put together. (umm) I normally don't like love stories and I only watched this because my girlfriend (umm) practically made me, but I found it kind of enjoyable. It had a pretty good storyline. And

I watched it not expecting very much out of it and I was actually entertained for about two hours that it lasted. If you like love stories or James Patterson, I would recommend Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas.
