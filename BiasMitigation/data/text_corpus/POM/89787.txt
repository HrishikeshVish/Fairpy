I'll be reviewing Ang Lee's Hulk. This is the two disc special edition. (umm) I didn't really think it was possible for them to make a movie about the Hulk that was actually boring, but somehow they managed to do it. (uhh) This is one of the movies where I really found myself just constantly looking at the (uhh) at the clock to see how much longer it had. You know, and I'm a pretty I'm pretty (stutter) big fan of, you know, slow paced movies. I don't need a whole, whole lot of action. But this one just was badly paced. (umm) You know, slow, (stutter) it was the characters weren't  developed enough, you know, to hold me, you know, during (ahh) the slower-paced parts of the movie and that kind of thing. (uhh) It was just kind of a poorly made movie in general. You know, Ang Lee just really tried to put too much style and not enough substance into it. 

(uhh) You know, the Incredible Hulk is basically about a scientist, Bruce Banner, who is messing with (uhh) gamma radiation. And he turns himself into (uhh) basically this gigantic, when he gets angry, he becomes this gigantic green, you know, ridiculously strong (uhh) hulk. 

And (uhh) {cough} basically his level of anger, you know, (stutter) correlates directly with, you know, how big he gets and, you know, the rest of the U.S. government and all that has to try and stop him, {mumble}. You know, it's not that complicated of a storyline, honestly. 

(uhh) The DVD itself isn't too bad. It's got some never (uhh) some deleted scenes, you know, (uhh) some (uhh) special effects documentaries. You know, look at taking the Hulk from the comics to the movie. (uhh) You know, a motion capture suit documentary. So, you know, and some stills from the comics, that kind of thing. Not a whole, whole lot in here. You know, honestly, I think it's a pretty forgettable movie and it's not one you really need to see.
