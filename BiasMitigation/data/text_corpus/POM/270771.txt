Mama Mia. (uhh) Not much to say about this movie besides it wasn't good at all. (uhh)

(stutter) like the whole point is that this, this (stutter) girl is about to get (stutter) like married and she wants to find out like who her real father is cause she wants to, cause she wants them to (stutter) like walk her down the aisle, and she has the possibility of three (uhh) so, so (stutter) like the whole entire film is about these, these (stutter) three people like, like (stutter) fighting, like saying that like he's the father, he's the father (stutter) instead of just being like hey, let's just go the doctor and let's get a test and see which one, 

and see which one it is instead of just wasting all this time fighting with each other. So (uhh) the movie's kind of pointless but it's has some funny parts. (uhh)

Pierce Brosnan's in it which is kind of a weird (stutter) movie I thought for him cause he's more like, like the action adventure guy with like James Bond and stuff like that, but, but he played (uhh) (stutter) he played a (stutter) pretty good (stutter) funny like role for this movie. But Mama Mia (stutter) I really wouldn't recommend seeing it unless like you're like, I dunno, unless you

think that you might like it. Like the trailer seemed enjoyable but then I went to see it and I was like so, so like, like (stutter) disappointed. So don't go see it, just wait for it to come out for DVD if you want. (uhh) I would have to give Mama Mia a two out of five in, in (stutter) my view, but, but (stutter) people have other opinions so (uhh) Mama Mia I'm going to have to give it a two, so that's it.
