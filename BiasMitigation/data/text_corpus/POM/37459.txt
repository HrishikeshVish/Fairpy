Hello, I'm Matthew, and I'm here to tell you about this DVD and it's called Ultraviolet. (umm) This is a science-fiction movie made by the same director of the movie Equilibrium, which was an excellent movie. I had high expectations,

(umm) because this was, like I said, from the same director of Equilibrium and I was 

very disappointed. (umm)

It's a sci-fi movie but it's very confusing, very choppy, (umm) it's kind of corny too. And it stars the same girl that was in (umm) 

The Fifth Element and Resident Evil. (umm) The only redeeming thing about this movie is probably the actress that's in it. (umm) She wears very little clothing and that's probably the only redeeming quality, is seeing her run around in (umm) belly shirts. But this is a horrible movie. I would stay clear of it and I would not recommend this movie.
