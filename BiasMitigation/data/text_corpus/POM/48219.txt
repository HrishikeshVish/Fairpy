Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this great dvd. It's called Pitch Black and it stars Vin Diesel.

This movie is a science fiction movie. (umm)

Its runtime in an hour and fifty-two minutes so it's just under two hours long.

This is a great movie (umm) I thought the acting was very well done and the directing style was very (umm) easy to watch and very fluid.

This movie (umm) if you like science fiction, is a great movie for you. Also if you like Vin Diesel I thought he did an excellent job. The storyline is that it's set in the future. And he, Vin Diesel is a prisoner. And their spaceship gets stranded on an alien planet and creatures come out at night and try to kill them, hence the name pitch black. (umm)

This movie is a lot of fun. (umm) It's very entertaining. And just under ten dollars I think this is a great buy and I would highly recommend it.
