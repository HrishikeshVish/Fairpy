Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger. I want to tell you a little bit about this movie called Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Now this is a little bit older movie, it got made and come out in nineteen-eighty-six so, you know, it's a good twenty years old but I will tell you it's one of the funniest movies (umm) that still appeals to young people as well as people like older people who've seen, who saw it twenty years ago.  And it's about this teenager who, you know, has, 

you know he's just got it, he's got it made. Everything he does turns to gold, he's the golden child type person and he skips school that day. And it's just about his day off and his escapades and the people that are around him and what happens to them and it's just a funny, funny movie. (umm) Matthew Broderick, you know, he's obviously a teenager back at this point in time. (umm) (stutter)

I'm thinking this is probably one of the movies that put him on the, on the (stutter) charts that people really saw him and (umm), 

you know, what he could do. He just did a spectacular job. (umm) Jennifer Grey is in this and there's a couple other people that you, that you (stutter) kind of see that, 

you know, now they're a little bit more famous actors but back then, you know, they were just starting out and it was just a fun movie to watch. It's rated PG-thirteen (umm) you know, because I think it has a little bit of language in it and (uhh), you know a little bit of, just a little bit of older subject matter but I tell you what, for teenagers, for older kids, for even the family movies this would be a good movie to watch. It's fun, it's it's (stutter) funny, it's got some good comedy in it (umm) and it's just about the escapades of a teenager for the day. (umm) It's a good movie to take a look at. (umm) 

You know, like I said it's called Ferris Bueller's Day Off and it stars Matthew Broderick.
