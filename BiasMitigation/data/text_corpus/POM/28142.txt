Hey shoppers, my name is Chip, and this is The Bourne Supremacy. (uhh) This is the sequel to The Bourne Identity starring (uhh) Matt Damon. (uhh) The story about an agent who (umm), in this particular episode, (umm) 

he knows who he is, (umm) he's met a girl in the last one and they have (uhh) started a new life (umm) across the ocean in another country, a little island.

And in this episode (uhh) people have tracked him down and

they are pretty sure that he knows details of the secret involvement with (uhh) Russian oil contracts and a lot of money and (uhh) espionage and they figure if they can take him out then their secret will be safe and 

(umm) all will be well. And it is (umm)

when they go after him 

(uhh) pretty much (umm) 

it breaks loose and he goes after them and (uhh) tries to settle the score. (umm)

It probably leaves it open for a (uhh) Bourne three. I hope it does because (uhh) 

both of these films have been (umm) extraordinary to watch and to follow and (uhh) Matt Damon (uhh) 

makes a great character (uhh) with this. 

(uhh) It's The Bourne Supremacy, with Matt Damon.
