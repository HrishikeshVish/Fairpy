Hi my name is Jordan and I'm going to be reviewing 

Master and Commander The Far Side of the World. 

Well this movie, it has Russel Crow in it. 

This movie came out a few years ago and it is awesome. 

It is basically about (umm) 

about a captain of a ship a long long time ago back in 

(uhh) the days of Napoleon and things like that. 

And (umm) it is very action packed, well it has a few action packed 

sequences. 

A lot of people complained about it because they didn't think it had 

enough action, but (umm) I thought that it had plenty. 

It was really a deep movie. 

It showed the life of these people, these sailors while they were 

sailing on the ships and I thought that was really interesting.

(umm) The movie's rated PG-thirteen because (uhh) 

there's some blood and guts and stuff like that and (uhh) some people 

get shot and things, which is natural for a Navy warfare movie, 

but (umm) it's really good and it's really (umm) 

it has a good storyline, and it's kind of educational. 

You really learn some stuff while you're (umm) watching this movie. 

So really I recommend it, so (uhh) if you can pick it up.
