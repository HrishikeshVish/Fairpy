Hello, I'd like to tell you that you should go see Captain America. It's really a great movie. It stars Chris Evans and

he is an unknown until this movie. I think he did a really good job. Since I had seen some of the older Captain America movies I thought it maybe it would just be too cheesy and too childlike and so I was going in with prejudice. So I was very happily surprised to find out that this guy can really act like a superhero and he can get away with it. The the (stutter) plot for Captain America is this young guy with not too much muscle and we don't know yet if he has a very good, you know, a very good mind. (umm) He tries to join the army repeatedly and never gets in for one reason or another, usually because he's just too scrawny. And then a scientist recognizes his potential, in not only his body potential because he he (stutter) thinks well maybe I can put him in this super army and develop him and also use his mind because he sees that (uhh) this guy is really, really intelligent. So basically he becomes a one man army. He is not taught that he is the only one, so he practices and builds and builds and builds and his mind does develop and his body develops as well. It's very convincing and the (uhh) effects of the movie are very good, the color is excellent, and really I think it's an overall really good job. So I'm going to give this one a thumbs up, go see Captain America.
