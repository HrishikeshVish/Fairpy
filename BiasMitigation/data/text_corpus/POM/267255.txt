What's up Expo TV. I have a (stutters) movie review for a Mike Meyers new movie called The Love Guru. Came out last week. Like there's been a lot of trailers

for it.

(uhh) it's ninety minutes long. It's rated PG-thirteen for crude and sexual content, language, some violence and drug references. (uhh) The movie's about how he was adopted by a by gurus. Like who are basically like, like, like, (stutter)

they know everything about dating and love and stuff and (uhh)

like he gets sent on this mission to like, I guess help out a marriage between between (stutter) Toronto Maple Leafs

player and like his wife because his wife has been seeing a guy from from the Los Angeles Kings. So (uhh) It's

So it's like so it's like (stutter) how

like he's like trying to help out this marriage. But like it really doesn't work cause it's supposed to be really funny. It's like Mike Myers does stuff like Wayne's World and like Austin Powers and stuff. So like this movie isn't supposed to be like a romantic comedy or something. It's like just

like a, really dull comedy I thought. I really don't like Mike Myers that much. I think he's definitely overrated. And this movie it (stutter) should, like the trailer should not be getting as many like slots, like during commercials that it's it's (stutter) like, getting cause it's really not good. (uhh) But see it I guess, if you like Mike Myers. It's not as good as like, it's not as good as Austin Powers or anything. But (uhh) It's called The Love Guru. (uhh) A couple cameo like appearances from from (stutter) players on the Toronto Maple Leafs and from the Los Angeles Kings so check it out if you want to. I would have to give The Love Guru a two out of five.
