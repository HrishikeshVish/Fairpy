Hello everyone. Playing over my shoulder here is Alien Resurrection, (uhh) and it's a pretty stupid movie. (uhh) The first Alien is a good movie. (uhh) Aliens is a very good movie. Alien three is not so good of a movie, and this is the worst of the four (uhh) in my opinion. (uhh) Sigourney Weaver, who died at the end of Alien three, is (uhh) genetically (uhh) brought back to life so she can star in another sequel that (uhh) tries very, very hard to be funny and just ends up being not funny at all. (umm) It has really good cinematography and a really good visual style the guy who directed it (umm), Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I'm not sure if I pronounced his name properly, I don't speak French, so pardon me, (umm) he also directed (umm) City of Lost Children and Delicatessen and (uhh) Amelie, (uhh) which is a pretty good movie. He directed this and I don't think he spoke English when he directed this, otherwise he may, might might (stutter) have have noticed how terrible a lot of the dialogue in this movie is. (umm)

It was written by (umm) Joss Whedon, that's right. He (uhh) wrote, I think, some episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't know. I really didn't care for this movie. (uhh) It doesn't add anything new to the franchise. (umm) Some of the actors are okay. (umm) Weaver does her best with what she's given, and (uhh) but it really doesn't amount to much in my opinion. (umm) As far as (umm) special features go on this disc, (uhh) the only thing that's on here is (umm) some interviews with the cast and crew, so if you, you know, are looking for some special features, this is not the edition to go for. (umm) I really don't like this movie. Don't buy it.
