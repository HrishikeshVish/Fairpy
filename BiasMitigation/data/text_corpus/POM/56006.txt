Today, I'm reviewing Event Horizon. This is the (uhh) the special collector's edition. It stars (uhh) Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner, and (uhh) also Joely Richardson, who is (uhh) the who stars in (uhh) Nip Tuck, which is a great show.

(uhh) Event Horizon it's a really cool concept actually event horizon's actually

(uhh) the point in space in which you can't get sucked or which outside of you cannot get sucked in to a black hole. So it's basically the (uhh) the furtherest extent of a black hole. It's kind of a sphere.

(umm) So it's a really cool concept in terms of the (uhh) the science behind it and then, you know, what happens if you were to get closer. 

(uhh) But it's just, it's just (stutter) a really gross movie. It's one of those movies that like it's scary movie, too.

(umm)

But it's real gross. There's just nasty blood and guts and

disgusting things hanging out all over this spaceship that basically goes to an alternate dimension, or hell, and then comes back and then these people go and try to rescue it because they think it's been a long lost (uhh) spaceship.

(umm) So, I wouldn't really (stutter) recommend this movie. I don't think it was very good. You shouldn't waste your time with it.
