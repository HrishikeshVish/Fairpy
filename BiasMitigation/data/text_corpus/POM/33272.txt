Hi, I am reviewing the (uhh) the movie Borat. 

(uhh) Cut in the full name of the movie is 

Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. 

And (umm) Borat is a fictional character played by a comedian Sasha Barat Cohen. 

And (uhh) 

you know, Sasha Cohen 

is the (uhh) 

the main star of the Ali G Show 

where he has three personas and basically are this. 

He (uhh) picks up a character named Borat from Kazakhstan and he (uhh) 

you know, goes through America and plays pranks on (umm) 

you know, Americans. 

And (uhh) sort of pretty, pretty funny movie in my opinion. (umm) 

(uhh) There are a lot of (uhh) questionable acts in the movie, such as a scene where him and (uhh) his partner are naked around the hotel. 

(umm) Upon viewing that in the movie theater (uhh) a few people decided to leave. 

(uhh) It's also been (uhh) flagged for anti-semitism. 

But (umm) to me it's all, 

it's all good comedy. (umm) 

Sasha Cohen is Jewish so you know, 

I just find the, his work funny and so do many others and that's why it's made so so (stutter) much money.
