This is Enter The Dragon on HD DVD.

Now this movie has been remastered completely for HD DVD and unlike the previous releases, it doesn't have that 

(uhh) does have the seventies look but doesn't have all the problems the other previous releases did, including there was a lot of a a lot (stutter) of kind of color mess ups. It wasn't very sharp. Even though it was an older movie, it wasn't exactly filmed on the best cameras or anything. 

It looked pretty bad on regular definition DVDs and they have done a fabulous job fixing it up for High Def DVD.

Now (umm) not only is this in ten eighty p and the audio is very nice, but it does include all features on previous SD DVDs. Which means it has four documentaries about Bruce Lee, his life and so on and about the movie. It does have one featurette regarding the filming of the movie, it was just a longer little thing. It has some photo galleries and it also has 

(umm) trailers and TV spots. 

This isn't anything too exceptional for a regular (uhh) DVD in terms of features, 

but it works pretty nice and it looks very good, which is of course the purpose of HD DVD.

Now this isn't a combo disc, this is just a straight up HD DVD. So you can purchase it for around say, twenty dollars at Target, maybe a couple more at Best Buy.

And I would have to say that this is a solid five out of five. Bruce Lee's best film in my opinion and a great way to show off older films in HD.
