This is  my review of Inventing the Abbotts. Filmed in nineteen ninety seven it's rated R and produced by Ron Howard. And (uhh) Brian Grazer. It's got

wonderful cast, it's got (stutter) Joaquin Phoenix before he became popular in Gladiator, got (uhh) Liv Tyler, Jennifer Connoly, Billy Crudup, (uhh) and it's narrated by Michael Keaton. It also has Cathy Baker in it. It is the story that's filmed in the (stutter) supposed to be in the nineteen fifties. (uhh) Three brothers from the wrong side of the railroad tracks raised by a single mother. (uhh) And they're chasing the three Abbott sisters and they're wealthy coming from a very affluent family. (uhh) The right side of the railroad tracks. And it's just a wonderful story, it's kind of one of those hidden gems that not too many people know about. (uhh) And it just goes through life, the simplicity of relationships, the complexity of relationships, (uhh) just the interactions of the boys it is told in the narrator's form (uhh) of Doug, which is the (uhh) Joaquin Phoenix character. And if you really haven't seen Inventing the Abbotts I highly recommend it.
