Hi, I'm Jodi and I'm here to tell you about the movie Ray.

It's an (stutter) extraordinary great movie.  

I didn't know he's such a womanizer 

but he's still good, and it teaches, it shows how he 

became blind and

how his childhood was and how he learned to listen

instead of walking with a cane he learned how to listen to his footsteps

and where he was by the sounds of the (stutter) floorboards,

and stuff so that was kind of neat. (umm) Jamie Fox did a really good job I was impressed.  

It's two hours and thirty-three minutes long which it's really worth to watch it, I liked it a lot.  

It has twenty-five entire minutes of extra additional footage that wasn't (stutter) shown in the theaters.  

Kind of fun too. 

And, it says about his love life and how he, you know, womanized and cheated. 

But, I really think you might like it, so I really suggest this, DVD.
