I watched You Don't Mess With the Zohan, starring Adam Sandler. And it's about Zohan, and he's an Israeli counterterrorist and he wants to become a hair stylist

and he moves to, I believe it was New York, to fulfill his dream of becoming a stylist. And I went into this movie thinking "man, this is going to be so awful". I was actually really mad at myself that I had to pay

for the price of the ticket cause I did not expect much. And my beliefs were true. It wasn't amazing. It was better than I thought, it was funny, but I definitely would not purchase the movie or want to see it again

and it was a movie that had so many dirty jokes that would appeal to mostly thirteen year old boys,

not to adults or. It was just kind of, it was a really stupid movie. If you like Adam Sandler you probably will like it cause most of his movies are,

are like that. But if you don't like those kind of movies then {noise} I wouldn't see it. (umm) The movie didn't have too much substance, it was basically summarized with the he wants to be a hair stylist. That's what it was about. He was a hair stylist and he did people's hair and that's basically

the whole movie. Put in, like, five hundred dirty jokes in there and then you've got it, that's that's (stutter) the movie alright. So if you're a thirteen year old boy I would go see this, or if you like Adam Sandler you should probably watch You Don't Mess With the Zohan.
