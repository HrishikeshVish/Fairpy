Hey, how you doing? My name is Roger. I want to tell you a little about this movie called The Italian Job. Now this is an action movie that (umm) this, this movie stars Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron in it and they both do a spectacular job in, in (stutter) their parts. And really what it's about, it's about this (uhh) this gang of thieves that (umm) (uhh)

are going after the big score. And then obviously it's a struggle between there's an (stutter) inner turmoil and then the (umm) you know, how they have to go (stutter) it's almost something like a a (stutter) Ocean's Eleven type movie. It's that type of feel, that type of (umm) (umm) adventure action type movie. It was very good, it was very enjoyable. (umm) They had a great little Mini Cooper chase scene and then those are always really cool. They got car, car (stutter) chases and you know there's some, there's some (stutter) good twists in there towards the end of how they foil the bad guy. Even though they're the bad guys there's someone worse than them, that type of thing. But you know it is it is (stutter) rated (uhh) P, it is rated R, no it's PG-Thirteen. (umm) Mostly that's probably from the language in it. There's some violence in it but (umm) I would say, you know, if you're interested in a little action packed movie kind of, kind of fun (umm) but it's got some meaning to it, a believable type movie, you know take a look at The Italian Job. It's a, it's a (stutter) good movie and it's worth the rent, okay? Thanks.
