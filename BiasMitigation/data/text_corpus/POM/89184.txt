Fighting Temptations.

This was such a cute movie. 

Thoroughly enjoyed it. 

(umm) my husband has actually seen it before me on cable and he said oh you gotta watch this movie and so we watched it and then I bought him this (umm) 

DVD for Christmas because I knew how much he enjoyed it, I actually looked around to be able to find it. It was hard to find

and Cuba Gooding, Jr. 

he's just so funny (umm) so much fun to watch in movies and he actually does some really good dancing in his movie and Beyonce Knowles is in it as the lead actress and 

they are just so (umm) engaging to watch (umm) beautiful people and I love the premise of the movie where he is kinda a no gooder and (umm) 

(uhh) he gets this inheritance (stutter) he's promised this inheritance and basically what he kinda does to think or to get his inheritance and just kinda how it's sometimes 

the good and bad in people and how we're torn to do what's right. And so it's a really good movie, great music and dancing and a great message.
