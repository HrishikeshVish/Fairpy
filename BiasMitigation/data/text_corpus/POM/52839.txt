Saving Private Ryan. 

This movie rules. (umm) 

It's won so many awards, it was the best grossing (uhh) highest actually, highest grossing film of ninety-eight. 

(uhh) It's two hours and forty-nine minutes long, 

and (uhh) it's pretty much on every top hundred list 

in the world for movies. (umm) 

Steven Spielberg won a ton of like, (uhh) highest honors from the army and stuff like that too, that that's (stutter) how good this movie was, like it was very realistic and it told from the perspective of a soldier. So 

it starts off 

(umm) with the invasion of Normandy. 

And the problem is 

(umm) Private Ryan has three brothers in the war as well 

and they all die. And so 

Tom Hanks is the main character and his goal to the entire thing is to find Private Ryan and bring him back to his mom so that she doesn't lose four sons. 

(umm) And they, and (stutter) embark on the epic journey where they're trying to decide 

why are we trying to save this one guy, it's it's (stutter) a war, like people die. 

Why are we saving one guy and there's eight of us risking our lives for this one guy. 

And so the whole story takes place them trying to decide that for themselves as they go and find him. 

And Matt Damon plays Private Ryan. And (uhh) overall I'd say it's a great movie, it definitely entertaining 

even though it's long. 

It, you won't, you won't (stutter) fall asleep in this one.
