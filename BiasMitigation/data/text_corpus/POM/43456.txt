Oh boy, this one is bad. It's 

(uhh) Covert One: The Hades Factor.

(uhh) It's (stutter) based on a series of silly 

(umm) FBI, CIA kind of government secret agent novels.

(umm) This one's called The Hades Factor. It's about 

(uhh) the disease that's starting to breakout and 

(uhh) this agent has to discover the source before it breaks out everywhere and kills millions of people. It stars 

(uhh) Mira Sorvino and Stephen Dorff.

(uhh) The movie unfortunately goes on and on and on. It feels like it's never gonna end and that's not helped by the fact that it's over two and a half hours long. I think it actually comes in at almost two hours and forty-five minutes. 

Do yourself a favor, don't watch this.

(uhh) There's no reason to sit through three hours of bad movie. 

(umm) You could maybe fast forward through it, but there's no point.
