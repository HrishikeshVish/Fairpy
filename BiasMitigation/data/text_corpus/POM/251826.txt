{cough} Hi, I'm Mike with expotv and this is my movie review of The Hottie and the Nottie. And this is (uhh) easily one of the worst films ever created. (uhh) For those of you not familiar with it, it is (uhh) features Paris Hilton and I believe she received top billing, so she is the star of the movie. (umm) She plays a girl who (umm) years ago, when she was about six or seven years old, had a mutual crush on a little boy about the same age. (umm) And we now grow up (uhh) twenty, twenty-five years later, and (uhh) we pick up the story where that boy goes back to find her and realizes that she is beautiful or perfect in his eyes but, and she would be considered the hottie, but there is a nottie who is not hot, for those of you not up on these terms. And it is a girl wearing obviously bad makeup, (uhh) bad hair, bad fat suit, all this kind of stuff and the minute you see her you can tell that somewhere underneath there a makeover is going to occur. So (uhh) it's just coming down the turnpike. (uhh) This movie should be avoided like the plague, it's completely awful. (umm) All the (uhh) the writers (uhh) should be indicted (umm) and all the actors (uhh),

you know, (stutter) tortured to some extent. So definitely avoid this film at all costs. I'm Mike with expotv.
