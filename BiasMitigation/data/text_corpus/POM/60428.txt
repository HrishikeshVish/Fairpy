In theaters now, better check it out before it leaves, is the movie called The Host. 

It is about a creature 

a sea monster that develops after some chemicals are poured down the drain 

and it attacks people, kills them and brings them to its secret lair. 

And there is a family, a father, 

a (uhh) grandfather, and an aunt and uncle I believe, 

who are all trying to (uhh) find the 

a young girl who the sea monster has captured and she gives them the call to let them know she's still alive. 

So that whole movie is the adventure of finding the girl, and nobody believes that she's actually alive, 

so they are on the run. They had to sneak out because they thought they were 

(umm) they were quarantined, 

big thing. Anyway 

lots of adventure. 

Fun movie, not the usual thing. 

I, it is, (stutter) it does have subtitles so if that's not your thing 

there's your warning. But 

(umm) it's a kind of 

thing where once you're watching the movie you forget you're even reading the subtitles. 

But anyway I really enjoyed it and I recommend you go see it. 

Also it's pretty long, so 

you might want to keep that in mind. 

But very long. I liked it.
