Hello, today I'm going to review

Semi-Pro starring Will Ferrell this is a movie that's basically a vehicle for more crazy Will Ferrell zany antics (uhh) he's playing a basketball player this time and that's basically all the plot there is to it. It really has no plot, just an excuse for Will Ferrell to do

crazy dumb things and (uhh)

basically I think Will Ferrell might be out of schtick

(uhh) all of his movies have been kind of dropping off into being repetitive and dumber and dumber and this one is probably the worst movie he's ever made. This has happened to a lot of the Saturday Night Live alum and (uhh)

speaking of Saturday Night Live movies it's just to give you an idea, I would say of all the bad movies that have ever come out of their characters this one would probably just barely beat Ladies Man. This is a really bad movie, it has no plot whatsoever and I really had high hopes for it because at his best Will Ferrell can be (uhh) apparently zany and funny, but spent a lot of money advertising (uhh) this movie, had multiple spots during the superbowl. They even put the semi-pro character into the sports illustrated swimsuit edition. You really couldn't get away from it and then you see the movie and really, really disappointing and it kind of think if it spent some money on writing instead of advertising it might have been a little bit better. (uhh) The

title Superbad hadn't already been taken recently I think that would have been a much better title for this movie, this movie's terrible I give it one star and give it a one half a star if that was an option, it's really bad don't go see it.
