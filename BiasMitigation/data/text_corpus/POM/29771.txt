Hello, and welcome to my review of I Am Trying To Break Your Heart by Sam Jones.  

This is a documentary 

about Wilco, one of the great American rock bands, and how in the year two-thousand

they began to record their fourth highly anticipated album

and a year later they found themselves with a completed album,

and a label that did not want to distribute, distribute (stutter) it 

and this is their story from (uhh), making that album to having that album rejected 

and finding another label 

and basically it's one of the great (umm) rock coups on the (uhh)

with the music corporation if you will 

(uhh) this is 

probably, this is probably (stutter) one of the best documentaries I've seen

(umm) that has to do with a band.  

It's, (uhh), it's (stutter) there are it's filed with interviews, music, (umm), it's just a great point of view.  

When Sam Jones began this documentary he had no idea what was going to happen.  

He just loved the band and he wanted to (uhh), make a story, create a story, and he got way more than he bargained for.  

This disc, (umm), its a, it's (stutter)two discs and the second disc comes with seventy minutes of extra footage, including 

(uhh) seventeen (umm) extra Wilco songs, 

(umm) alternate versions of songs.  

There's also a featurette.  

(umm) This has, this the first disc has a trailer.  

This is a great documentary and a must have for any fan of the band Wilco.  

(umm) This is I am Trying to Break Your Heart, a band, a film about Wilco by Sam Jones.  

I definitely recommend it.
