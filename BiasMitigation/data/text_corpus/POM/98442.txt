I picked up Dark Blue on the recommendation of a friend.

(umm) and I must say that I was not impressed.

(umm) I was not really familiar with Kurt Russell outside of a few TV movies that I'd seen on TNT or TBS and I should have taken a clue from those movies because

(uhh) he just, as a lead actor he just does not carry this role. I cannot buy into him

(uhh) at all.

(stutter) His dialogue just comes across as cheesy. He can't deliver the one liners well.

(umm)

And all in all, 

just, I just was not entertained by this movie at all. If you're looking for 

(umm) a movie about corrupt cops and the battle from within, I would recommend Training Day or

(umm) I like Confidential

over Dark Blue

(uhh) any day of the week.

(umm) There are some memorable lines here, but again 

the acting just really didn't deliver with the kind of conviction needed to make this movie believable.

It's not , it's not (stutter) a bad movie, it's just definitely not a great movie. If you've got nothing else to rent or to watch,

pick this one up. Otherwise, leave it alone.
