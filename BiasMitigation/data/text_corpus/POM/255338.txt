What's up Expo Tv. I have a movie review called College Road Trip. Came out March two thousand eight. (uhh) Went to see this with my younger sister. It was absolutely terrible. It was directed by Roger Cumble and it's (uhh) about how (stutter) this high student which is (stutter) Raven from (stutter) That's So Raven (uhh)

goes around the country to choose a college that she wants but her dad who's a cop but played by Martin Lawrence, (uhh) goes along with her to try and find the perfect college for her. And (uhh)

it's just a really terrible movie to and, terrible attempt at a comedy. It's definitely directed towards like a younger generation cuz of like Raven was in it.

(uhh) But

it was absolutely terrible. I do not recommend checking this out. If I could give it a zero I would but I know there's no option for zero so I'm going to have to give College Road Trip a one out of five and recommend that everyone stays away from this movie. I don't know why they released this in theaters, it doesn't deserve to be in theaters. (uhh) So College Road Trip a one out of five.
