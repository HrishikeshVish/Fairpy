Today I will be talking about The Italian Job. (umm) It stars Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg. This one it came out in two-thousand and three, it's in full color, and this one is a fullscreen collector's edition. This movie is a remake of the nineteen-sixty-nine Italian Job and they both kind of have the same concept going on. (umm) 

It starts off with a group of friends, these guys are, you know, actually thieves and they're stealing a bunch of gold from this guy but part of their team ends up, you know, betraying them and

so suddenly they're not the bad guys anymore and this other guy is and the rest of the movie is just kind of about how they're trying to take back what was theirs and, you know, kind of like. 

It's a good movie {laugh} 

but (umm) it's full of action, there's lots of car chases, boat chases, (umm) it's a really good movie and even if you don't like action packed movies this one is like, I don't know, there's something about it, it's good. If you're a girl you'll enjoy it if your boyfriend is like "hey let's watch this movie." It's not like those other action packed movies. (umm) It's really good and I definitely recommend it

but (umm) it's rated PG-thirteen for violence and some language. There's no sexuality in it whatsoever so that's good. But it's a good (stutter) movie and I recommend it.
