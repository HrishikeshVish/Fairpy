I want to talk to you about Disturbia. This is a new movie 

(uhh) in which a character is confined to his house, he is under house arrest, and his mother takes away his Xboxes and TV as sort of a little bit of additional punishment. So he starts watching out his window, watching people for entertainment until he sees (uhh) something that basically (uhh) horrifies him. He thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is really nothing that he can do about it because he is under house arrest. (uhh) If this plot sounds very familiar I think I saw this movie (uhh) many years ago. It actually came out about forty years and it was called A Rear Window and it starred Jimmy Stewart, and he was confined to his house because his leg was broken and in general I think that is a much better movie than the movie I have just seen in theaters. 

(uhh) I kind of felt a little bit cheated because (uhh) the plot is (uhh) very similar. You know, Jimmy Stewart relies on the people around him and his girlfriend to kind of investigate and figure out what was going on. Saw a lot of the same things happen in this movie and (uhh) this movie felt a little bit cheaper. They kind of tried to stylize it a little bit (uhh) for the younger audience but in general (uhh)

I really didn't think it was worth the money. Save your seven bucks, go to the video store, rent A Rear Window, you're going to like that movie a lot much better. I would rather buy that movie, (uhh) the Rear Window I mean, than to see this one again. If you do want to see this wait for it to come out on video and rent it, don't buy it. I don't think it's worth it.
