Okay, so here we have the movie 

Dirty Dancing. It's a classic, if you haven't seen it you need to go pick it up. 

(umm) This is the ultimate edition, which it has two discs. 

(umm) There's an insane amount of features on this so if you like this movie then I definitely think you should pick up the ultimate edition DVD set. If you haven't seen this movie, it was released in nineteen eighty seven. It's a comedy, it features Patrick Swayze 

(umm) Jennifer Grey. It was actually a low budget film, but obviously now it's a really huge hit. 

(umm) The soundtrack is one of the best selling of all time. It's about this girl Baby who goes on vacation with her family. She falls in love with a dance instructor, hence the title Dirty Dancing.

(umm) It's definitely one of my most favorite movies.

(umm) Their love was forbidden because her father didn't approve of it.

(uhh) In the end they realize that Johnny is an okay guy. This is usually a movie that girls like more than guys. But hey, try and get your boyfriend to watch it with you. 

(umm) But definitely Dirty Dancing.
