Today I'm reviewing Office Space, it's the special edition with flair. 

And it is from creator Mike Judge 

(uhh) as I said earlier it's a special edition you get a lot of extra bonus features. 

(uhh) Special features include out of the office it's an all new office space 

(uhh) retrospective with writer and director Mike Judge. 

Eight never before seen deleted scenes. It has a DVD-ROM content office space audio clips and screen savers, and it also contains the original theatrical trailer which is nice. 

(umm) This is a really good movie, it's very very funny, 

(uhh) Dolby digital, you can you know have it in Spanish also and then in French in closed caption. 

(uhh) It is eighty-nine minutes long. 

You can also get it subtitled in English and in Spanish so if you can't hear well you can you know, read it. 

(umm) And then it is also rated R for language and brief sexuality. Office Space is a really funny movie if you haven't seen it I don't know where in the heck you've been the last couple years. 

(uhh) It's a great movie and the cast is extremely funny. 

(umm) I would highly recommend that you pick up Office Space,
