Today I'm reviewing Diary of a Mad Black Woman. It's a Tyler Perry movie. (umm) It's a really good movie. It is rated PG-thirteen. (umm) This is a movie about a woman who is pretty much gone through a divorce, she's kicked out of her house. (umm) By her husband who she's kinda helped with (umm) going to law school and stuff like that so he ends up kicking her out with and she has nothing. (umm) While she was with him he kinda {cough} alienated her from her family, so when she's kicked out she ends up going (umm) to her grandmother I believe who is Madea. (umm) And so it's just kind of a tale of the struggles that she has going through the divorce. She really loves her husband and (stutter) wants him back. (umm) He's not wanting her, (umm) so she (stutter) ends up meeting somebody else, (umm) and then he gets into (umm) some trouble and she goes to help her husband. (umm) So it's a really good movie and I do recommend it, it's very funny also.
