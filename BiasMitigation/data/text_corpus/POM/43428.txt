Hi, we're reviewing the DVD Hard Rain. It's a movie starring Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman. It's also got Randy Quaid and Minnie Driver. (uhh) In the movie it takes place in a small town that's being evacuated because of a flood and (uhh) Christian Slater is an armored car driver who's stuck in the middle of it. (umm)

There's a group of thieves led by Morgan Freeman who want to steal the money from him, but for some reason he's willing to risk his life to protect the stupid truck full of money. (umm) The movie doesn't make any sense. (uhh)

It's just a cheesy action movie. (umm) Guns and explosions and Christian Slater in a wet t-shirt. (umm)

I wouldn't recommend it, there's no special features, there's really no reason to buy the DVD. If you really want to see it for some reason just rent it, but (uhh) even that's kind of a waste of (uhh) about an hour and a half, so (uhh)

don't.
