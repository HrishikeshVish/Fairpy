This is a movie called Summer Magic and it stars Hayley Mills and Burl Ives 

and of course Burl Ives is dead now but (uhh) it's really kind of a musical and

(uhh) Hayley Mills is from a well to do Boston family and they lose their money 

and (uhh) I think it's the mother and Hayley Mills and you know, a couple of siblings

and they end up moving to this town in Maine which Burl Ives is the post master there and he

kind of rents Hayley Mills 

(umm) this house based on a letter that Hayley Mills writes to him

and (uhh)

the house is actually owned by another guy but the (stutter)

Burl Ives kinda manages the house.

So he rents it to them, course they can't pay any money, they can't pay any rent for it

and so it's a good story. Eventually the (stutter) 

owner of the house comes to town to check on the property and finds out that Hayley Mills and their family is living there with 

you know not paying any rent. So that becomes interested (stutter) interesting. It's a funny story, it's a nice family movie. It's an older movie, but I would definitely recommend seeing it and you can get this at amazon dot com for under twelve dollars.
