Yo, what's up expotv dot com? Today I will be reviewing the skateboard DVD movie 

Suffer the Joy, made by Toy Machine skateboards. This is the newest Toy Machine skateboard movie and it is

my favorite so far and

(umm) the skating was okay in it, not as good as in the old one, but the reason I love this video so much is because of the bonus feature entitled Billy's balls. 

Billy's balls is, (umm) features one of their team riders, Billy Marks, and he just does the most amazing stuff with ping pong balls. 

He (uhh) has a cup filled with (umm) halfway with water, and he sets it like (umm) on a (stutter) ping pong table and then he's like blindfolded and just throws the ball and it lands in the cup. He just does so many (umm) things with ping pong balls. He (umm)

hits one with a golf club and it goes straight into the cup, and he doesn't even get excited about it. He just is so chill and

(umm) that's what made me like him cause he's not a bragger. (umm) Five out of five star video, for sure.
