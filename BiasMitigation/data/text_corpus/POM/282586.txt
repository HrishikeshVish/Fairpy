Hello. I want to talk to you about a movie I recently saw. It's called Twilight. Actually, (uhh) this is not your typical review. It's almost a warning. Do not let your girlfriend drag you to see Twilight. This movie is aimed at young girls. And (uhh) for some reason some of the older girls seem like to like it as well. But basically this is a movie for young, teenage girls and there's nothing there. There's not much of a plot. It's kind of run of the mill plot of a, a (stutter) young girl who gets sent away from her parents to back to, to her, her (stutter) father who, who lives in a different town. She goes to a new school and she's not fitting in. She sees a dreamy young boy and oh yeah, he happens to be a vampire. But he's not a bad vampire, he's a good vampire. He doesn't even drink people blood anymore. (uhh) except for some reason he's so infatuated with her he wants to drink her blood. And she's so infatuated with him that (uhh) she might just let him, and that's basically the tension for the whole movie. (uhh) will he? Won't he? Will she let him? (ehh) whatever. Drink blood, it's just kind of stupid. I guess it's supposed to be some sort of romantic tension there and all the young girls in the audience went crazy for it, and I guess they thought the guy was dreamy or hot, or whatever they think nowadays. But, to me,

I just wanted to go to sleep. It's not a good movie. There's nothing there. And (uhh) frankly, vampires aren't supposed to be this mushy romantic characters. And if you really want to go that route, go watch Dark Shadows reruns somewhere on TV, they have to be out there somewhere. They're a lot better. So, (uhh) see something else. See a real movie. See a real man movie, something with explosions or something. Don't go see this movie.
