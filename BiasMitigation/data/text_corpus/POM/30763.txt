Hi. My name's Jennifer and today I'm going to talk to you about How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days. 

Now this movie stars Kate Hudson and Mathew McConaughey and it is made by Paramount Pictures. It is an absolutely brilliant movie. This is my favorite romantic comedy of all time. I love Kate Hudson, Mathew McConaughey together. There's sparks flying in this movie, they're just so good together. (umm) You can really see the interaction between them. And basically Kate works for a magazine and she writes a column 

how to 

something in ten days. So 

what she chose to do was how to lose a guy in ten days and 

Mathew McConaughey wants to get a contract (umm) for the diamond 

market and to do so he has to make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. So the two just happen to meet and (umm) they're paired up together 

and she's trying to drive him away and he's trying to woo her over. So it's just a battle of who can win. Can she lose him or can he make her fall in love with him? It's just very funny the way Kate Hudson just dominates (umm) being the woman of the relationship. At first she's just so great and then she does everything she knows guys hate. It's so great, cause everyone knows the classic cliches. (umm) Calling twenty times a day or talking baby talk or just putting stuffed animals all over his apartment. Things like that, and she's so great. And Mathew McConaughey is just the most frustrated man and he plays it so well, and they're both

such good actors and actresses so I definitely recommend Kate Hudson Mathew McConaughey's How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days by Paramount Pictures.
