What's up Expo Ben Mazo here again, today I'm reviewing the movie of Save the Last Dance. Starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas. I didn't enjoy this movie at all. So if I was you, I would not buy this or rent this, it's just a waste of money. It's (uhh) it's just pretty much a chick flick about dance and drama. (umm)

I am, I'm just not into those type of movies I mean that's just me but, if you like dance and drama movies go for it. I mean, I don't know. And

pretty much just about

this girl who wants to just be a dancer and everything and she meets a friend and he helps her out and everything but. Not going to ruin the plot for you or anything but I don't I don't even know if I should just ruin the plot because it's not that great of a movie, I don't even want you to see it. But I don't know, I'm giving it one out of five stars for this movie. Not a very good movie, so (uhh)

don't pick it up today I guess. (uhh)

I mean if you like Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas I guess you could try it, I don't know. I didn't like it but

I'll let, everyone has their own opinion so.

Save the Last Dance, one out of five stars.

Later.
