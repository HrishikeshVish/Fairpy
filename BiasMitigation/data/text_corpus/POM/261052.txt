Hello, my name is Mike, and today I'll be talking to you about the movie Nim's Island. As formality here is my movie ticket.

And there we go.

Now that's out of the way let's talk about the movie. So the basic premise of the movie: little girl lives on an island that's full of crazy wonderfulness.

Wonderfulness is probably not the best word to describe it, it's full of crazy adventure

style things. And this is a child's adventure movie, it makes sense. It kind of reminds the little girl

and the audience of this a certain author's storybooks.

This is of course a fictional author based in the movie.

Of course the author lives no life like the one she portrayed in the books.

She portrays really nothing like it,

but so when the little girl's parents get kidnapped and disappear

that author has to come and try to help her.

It's a kind of convoluted plot, it barely makes any sense, but that's not a surprise since it's a kid's movie. Movie's aimed toward ten-year-old girls and I think it accomplishes what it wants to accomplish for that audience.

So, you know, if you're a ten-year-old girl you'll probably love it. If not, well,

you should probably know whether or not you're going to like this movie. You know honestly I give it, I'm going to give it a two out of five. It's alright, does what it needs to do.

And you know you might give it a higher rating if you are a ten-year-old girl or, you know, somewhere in that range. A kid's movie, especially a girl's movie. So two out five, thank you and goodnight.
