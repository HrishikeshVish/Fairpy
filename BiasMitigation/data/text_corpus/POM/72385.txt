Hi, today I'm (stutter) reviewing the movie Delta Farce. 

I didn't say force, I said farce. 

Stars Larry the Cable Guy, Bill Engvall, and D.J. Qualls. 

This has got to be the dumbest movie I've ever seen. 

There's three 

reservists, old time reservists from the south, drunk. 

Worthless people.

And they (uhh)

have their big, get orders to be sent to Iraq.

On their way to Iraq in a plane.

They decide they don't want to sleep on the plane so they go back and sleep in a military jet.

I mean a military jeep.

Well sure enough the jeep gets dropped in the middle of the desert some place. They wake up, and they think they're in Iraq.

But instead they're in Mexico.

So they

start a war in Mexico against some rebels.

It's dumb, it's stupid, it's boring.

(uhh) A lack of taste, (uhh) what other bad words can I think of. (uhh)

I've never seen a movie like this, I don't want to see another one like it. 

So I think they should've dropped the word delta 

and just went with the farce. Because it's not a movie, it's a joke. 

I watched Larry the Cable Guy shows and they've been 

funny and 

okay. This is not even

that funny, and it's not even okay. Not gonna even give it an okay rating. 

I give Delta Farce exactly what it deserves, a rating of one,

and a thumbs down, ninety-nine. This is a farce.
