The Shawshank Redemption is what I'm going to be video reviewing tonight. 

And this is an amazing movie, this is one of my favorites of all time. 

The story follows a man, Andy Dufresne, 

who is (uhh) wrongfully imprisoned. 

Now the (uhh) 

the story is mostly just about his experiences in life in prison. 

He meets up with Red, Morgan Freeman, 

and just generally has a bunch of, 

I wouldn't necessarily call them adventures, but this 

(uhh) explores his life and times very well. 

(umm) 

Now I'm not gonna reveal any of the secrets of the movie. 

But 

it's just very, very good. It's kind of long, it's about a hundred-and-forty-two minutes long, so don't sit down and watch this unless you got some time 

on your hands. 

But I think, I know I would be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't like it. 

(umm) My favorite part 

was probably 

all of his, 

Andy Dufresne's interactions with the prison guards. 

Because there's, 

played so well by the actors. 

You can really sense say

a dynamic and a a (stutter) difference between prisoner and (uhh) 

prison guard. Even though it is just acting, it's so very good. 

So if you're looking for a fantastic movie, 

check out The Shawshank Redemption. 

I guarantee it. You're gonna like it.
