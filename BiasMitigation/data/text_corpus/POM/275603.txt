I'm reviewing Elf the Christmas movie that has become a classic now, it is with Will Ferrell as Buddy the elf, (umm) Bob Newhart who is poppa elf Buddy's father Ed Asner is actually in it he is Santa, (umm)

Buddy finds out that he really is not an elf that he was

(uhh) taken by Santa by accident back to the North Pole and raised as an elf but he is a large person so he finds out who his real parents are which are James Con and his mother is actually deceased, finds out James Con lives in New York so he wants to go visit his father, and so he goes there and becomes apart of the real world instead of the elf North Pole world and goes through many funny thing's in corporate America (umm) he likes to eat all the sweets the food groups are sweets and (umm) he finds out he has (uhh) brother, little brother to he doesn't like him to begin with but then he he (stutter) (uhh) he starts to love him and, how he helps Santa in the end and he also falls in love with (uhh) elf,

woman elf that is (umm) playing an elf at the department store that Santa is going to be at. Anyway it's very funny,

very family oriented.
