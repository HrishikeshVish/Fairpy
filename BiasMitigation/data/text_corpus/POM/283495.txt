Hi, you're watching my video review of Role Models.

This is a comedy that's rated R. There's a lot of cursing and crudeness but unfortunately it's not a funny movie. The humor in the movie feels really forced, like they're trying too hard and the writing's not very good.

The movie is pretty formulaic, you know how the movies gonna end and I guess you could say that about a lot of movies in Hollywood but

at least try to be funny along the way but this movie doesn't really deliver that.

The character played by Sean William Scott is pretty annoying. Sean William Scott is

Stifler in every movie that he's in, and that might've been funny back when he made American Pie like ten years ago or however long it was but, when you play the same character in every movie it starts to wear thin and just wasn't that funny.

So, I would recommend looking somewhere else

and not watching Role Models. Thanks for watching my video review.
