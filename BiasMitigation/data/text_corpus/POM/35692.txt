(umm) What it is is, they went back and they took all of the music out of the movie and they had an orchestra play the music (umm) while people were watching the movie and they include that version, like they recorded the orchestra you know, playing it and I mean it was pretty cool I mean I really, you couldn't tell as much, I mean you couldn't tell a lot and only in certain places you could tell, (umm) one of them being the end when everybody claps you kinda like, oh wait, oh that's right, this isn't, this is (stutter) a live performance.
