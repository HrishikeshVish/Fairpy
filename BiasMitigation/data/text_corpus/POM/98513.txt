Hello, I'm Matthew I'm here to tell you about this dvd. This is Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

(umm) It stars Robert Downey Junior and Val Kilmer.

(umm) This is a great movie (umm) if you like movies like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch, (umm) I think you will enjoy this movie. (umm) This is a comedy (umm) it's also has some action in it, and (umm)
