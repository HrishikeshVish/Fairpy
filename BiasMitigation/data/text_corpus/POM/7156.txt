Hi, my name is Jordan and I'm gonna be reviewing the movie Napoleon Dynamite, and this movie was really, really, really funny. (umm)

A lot of people (uhh) they didn't think it was very funny. It's really a kind of cult classic kind of movie. (umm) You'll only like it if you're into kid of strange, bizarre humor. (umm) Things that (uhh)

you usually wouldn't find funny were in this movie. (uhh)

It's basically about (uhh) a guy who's really a geek, a big geek and (umm) he tries to get his Mexican friend to (umm)

to run for class president and that's basically the premise of the movie. There there (stutter) isn't much of a plot it's mostly just humorous situations and I spent most of the movie laughing, I thought it was really funny.  However, a lot of my friends, a lot people I know thought the movie was completely stupid and a waste of time. So it really depends on your humor. I find random stuff and things like that funny. So if you find random things and (uhh),

you know, stuff like that funny then I would definitely pick this up. But if not, I'd stay away.
