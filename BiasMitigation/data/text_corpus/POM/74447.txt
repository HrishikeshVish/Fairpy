However, (uhh) that can definitely be challenged by some of the roles he's taken.

(umm) When I first saw his appearance in this movie those are exactly the words I thought to myself Was this is the greatest actor of all time?

The movie I'm speaking of is The Island of Doctor Moreau.

Marlin Brando plays a

somewhat mad scientist

(uhh) who is not bent on world domination, just his genetic experiments where he combines humans and animals.

(uhh) It was also starring Val Kilmer as his crazy veterinarian assistant who (uhh)

gets taken to the island of Doctor Moreau where he falls in love with one of his experiments, who he claims is his daughter.

(uhh) (uhh) Anarchy breaks loose and its supposed to be (uhh)

The acting in it is comical as opposed to serious, so if you're looking for a movie that you can take seriously do not get it.

I personally had a lot of fun making fun of it while watching it.
