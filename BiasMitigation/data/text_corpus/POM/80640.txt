Hi. (umm) Today the product that I'm going to review is a DVD called If Someone Had Known. This is a (umm)

I believe true story based

on Katie Liner. She was a police officer's daughter who (umm)

met a guy, had fallen in love with him, and they ended up of course getting married. After she married him (umm)

she found out that he is abusive and instead of telling someone what was happening she just ignored it

or she didn't, she didn't (stutter) let anyone know because she was ashamed, especially of what her father would think of her. And (uhh) finally, you know, she tells,

her father finds out that he was abusive. And it's it's (stutter) a really good movie. It stars Kellie Martin, and it's about

two hours long but (umm) it's a good movie about like marital abuse and (uhh) the story of her life. But if you're interested in watching this you can find it on amazon dot com or cheap DVD discounts for under fifteen dollars.
