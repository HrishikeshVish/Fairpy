Hi. 

This is the Nine Inch Nails All That Could Have Been live DVD, 

from two thousand.

And if you wanted to check out Nine Inch Nails live,

this is a pretty good representation. 

It's from their fragile tour 

and it has eighteen songs on here on two discs, 

and it has two formats for sound. 

I think there's just the normal stereo one and there's a surround 

sound as well. 

The picture quality's really good. 

They also came out with the cd at the same time, 

but the cd has I think about fifteen tracks, so this has three more on it. 

And I've watched this quite a few times and it doesn't really get 

old if you're into Nine Inch Nails you're going to like this for

a while. 

And I saw them on the last tour about four times, 

and I think this one is entertaining because it has different visuals 

and stuff. 

So if you've been checking on Nine Inch Nails and you want to see 

visually what it's like to be at the show, this is the, 

pretty much only DVD out there right now and it's (uhh) 

it's a little expensive. 

It's probably about twenty five thirty dollars but it's definitely 

worth it. 

Thank you.
