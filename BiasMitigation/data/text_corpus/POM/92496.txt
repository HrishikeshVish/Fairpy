Hey, 

(uhh) this is a review of

Are We Done Yet which is a (uhh)

(uhh)

abysmal movie starring (uhh) 

ice cube. It was (uhh) 

it was a pain to sit through really it was 

it was kinda a mystery that it was 

was made you know. There was probably a lot better movies that

get passed up but

this

somehow made it. (umm) It 

feels like about half a movie should've been cut which would be kinda a short film but (uhh) 

probably would've been easy to sit through. (uhh)
