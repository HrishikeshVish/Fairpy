Hey, y'all. It's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review ten thousand BC, (uhh) which recently came out in theaters. It's (uhh) from the director of Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow. And (uhh) while I found those films (uhh), particularly Independence Day, to be pretty good, (umm)

(uhh) ten thousand BC fails in that department. (uhh) It's about basically a, a (stutter) tribe of people who, (uhh) you know, like someone who (uhh) one, one (stutter) person gets (uhh) like a princess kind of deal happens where (uhh) she gets kidnapped and basically the tribe goes out to rescue her and then they meet other tribes and a whole kind of war happens. (umm) I thought the ending especially was, (uhh) was pretty horrible. (uhh) I don't want to ruin it, but (uhh) they, let's just say that they tried to surprise the audience all of the sudden with (uhh) a kind of (uhh)

(uhh)

just just (stutter) new (stutter) introduction of new characters, and I thought that was fairly week and disappointing. (umm)

It's, (uhh) it's been getting (uhh) pretty negative reviews by the press, but I tried to go into it with an open mind, (uhh) particularly because I liked Independence Day and (uhh) unfortunately it failed. The CGI, (uhh) there was a lot of CGI. Some of it's good. Some of it's kind of bad. (umm) There, it just wasn't my cup of tea. Wasn't well executed, pretty formulaic, bad ending, wouldn't recommend watching it. And that's my review of ten thousand BC.
