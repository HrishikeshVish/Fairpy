Hey expo tv, today I'm gonna review for you the movie Jennifer's Body. Which is a movie that's currently in theaters. (uhh) This movie is rated R, there's some graphic violence and (umm) (uhh)

cursing in this movie so that's why it's rated R. (umm) I loved this movie. I thought this was a great movie. It stars Megan Fox, Adam Brody and Amanda Seyfried. (umm) Those are the three leads in the movie. And I don't want to give too much away about it but it's about Megan Fox's character is Jennifer and she gets possessed (umm) by a demon and I won't tell you how because you find that out in the movie and it's really funny. (umm) And she basically has to kill people to stay healthy. (umm) As this demon and to keep you know, keep feeding on boys basically is what she decides to do in order to keep herself healthy. (umm) Amanda Seyfried plays her best friend Anita, (umm) who you find out in the very beginning of the movie is in a mental institution and you see why through the course of the movie what happened. (uhh) Adam Brody plays the lead singer of this indie band. (umm) And he has something to do with why Jennifer becomes possessed by this demon. (umm) It's really funny, it's a dark comedy. There is, it is pretty scary there's some (stutter) suspenseful parts to this movie that I wasn't expecting so it was scary. (umm) And it is, you do kind of have to get over the fake teenage dialogue that's in this movie. It's by the same person who wrote Juno so there's a lot of that you know, type of dialogue going on. (umm) It's silly but you know, you you (stutter) forget about it when you're watching the movie. I loved this movie this is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
