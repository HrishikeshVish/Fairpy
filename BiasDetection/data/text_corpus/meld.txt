also I was the point person on my companys transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
You mustve had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.
So lets talk a little bit about your duties.
My duties?  All right.
Now youll be heading a whole division, so youll have a lot of duties.
I see.
But therell be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
Good to know.
We can go into detail
No dont I beg of you!
All right then, well have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, youll fit in well here.
Really?!
Absolutely.  You can relax
But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
You know? Forget it!
No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know
Ok!

He was with her when he wrote this poem.
Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside.
Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.'
He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.

Hi.
Howd did it go?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldnt shut up.
Im so proud of you.
Me too!
Listen, Im ah, Im sorry Ive been so crazy and jealous and, its just that I like you a lot, so...

Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
You fell asleep!!
There was no kangaroo!
They didnt take any of my suggestions!
Thats for coming buddy.
Ill see you later.
Dont go!
Im sorry.
Im so sorry!

Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring.
See, if Im not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity

Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.

I'm back.
Ok.  Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "Hey, you're not Bob."
I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.
Ok, pure evil , horny and alone . I've done this
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!

What?!
Whats wrong with you?
Nothing!
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.
But um, I dont think its anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-you go to the doctor!
No way! Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Thats a hernia.
Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
I love your place! Where is this guy from?

Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
I knew that was him!
Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
Hey, you ok?

There was hum...  there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey.
I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone  else.

You are not supposed to give people advice!
Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?
I
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike!
She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone

Oh, hey, how about this one.
Ah, its says so in the script!
Y'know ah, I-I dont know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that youre a bitch.

Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
Sure. So how long you been...
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
Since then?!
No, it's only been six years.
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
...Joe.
Y'ever been in love?
...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
You're one to talk.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
Everythings gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!!  Thats supposed to be a duck right? Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Hey, Rach, how was work?
Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasnt a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming.
Im just gonna throw it out, its probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Something wrong?
No. Nothing.
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.
Yeah, that's it?
Yeah.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!
No, no, youre right, it is a ridiculous name!
Its not that bad.
Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
So, youre just Bing?
Because we won our apartment back!

Yeah baby!
But, we pick again! We pick again!
I dont know!
Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby!
You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
It's gonna be worth it.
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
Women love guys who love babies.
It's that whole sensitive thing.
Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there.
Maybe one of them will break away.
No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left.
All right, gimme the baby.
No, I got him.
Oh, seriously you want him?
Hello.
Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?
You wanna smell him?
Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
Well, we are great guys.
Well, not really.
I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Well Ross, you be careful now. You dont want to get a reputation as yknow Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
What?! Youre going out with her again!
Going out with who?
Well, not really.
I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Yeah. What-what should I do?
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
I mean whats more important?
What people think or how you feel, huh?
Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
I mean whats more important?
What people think or how you feel, huh?
Ross, you gotta follow your heart.

Joey! You didnt even know her!
Ah whatever!
Joey that is so sweet.
Hey.
Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.
What?! Youre going out with her again!
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Joey! You didnt even know her!
Well Ross, it seems pretty clear.
I mean whats more important?
What people think or how you feel, huh?
Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Hey.
Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
I couldnt do it.
You couldnt do it?!
Hey, relax I just need more time. Were going to dinner tonight.
Well, not really.
I mean technically its-its not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon.
Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
Going out with who?
Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Wasnt she uh
No, that was Dana Caplin.
Morning! Hey, hows my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!
Dont touch him!
Okay!
All right.
Umm, all right Wayne, level with me.
I-I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part!
Come on man, you-you got to give me a second chance!
I mean, I love-I love this little guy!
Ah-ah!!
Okay, thats why you didnt want me to touch him right?
Here you go!
Okay?
Stupid!
I cant believe it!
God!
Hey, how you doin?
Hey.
Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
You had no
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
But I told you, I didnt have the time!
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
Wh, Ross what do you want from me?
You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
I know.
Ooh, I have to tell you something.
What?
But I cant tell you.
Okay, but wouldnt it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldnt tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
No.
Does it have to do with Joey?
No.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
No, but lets come back to that later!
Hi!
Richard!
Actually, Im not here to complement the chef.
Ohh Oh, thats okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
Like I have nothing better to do!
So whats up?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
No! I came here to tell you something else.  I came here  to tell you I still love you.
One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
Come here!
No! Seriously! Whats wrong with you?!
Maybe!  Well! Wellso-so uh, what kind of music does Numb NutsOh forget it! I cant!
Joey, I am scared to death about this.
But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.
And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?
Because! Cause Cause youre my baby sister!
And youre my big brother!
I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.
Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
I was scared of telling you.
Well Id be scared of them, but all right.
Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
I want him to have his uncle.
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Of course hes gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Were gonna be all right. I mean, even if were not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
Thats right! By his uncle too!
Joey, I am scared to death about this.
But I really think I can do it, Im just gonna need some help.
And Bobbys gonna be here the whole time.
You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, were straight-up gangster rap.
Look, Rachels told me how much easier youve made all this on her. Why cant you do that for me?
And youre my big brother!
I mean, youre my favorite guy in the whole world.
Im not even scared to tell mom and dad.
I was scared of telling you.
Joey, I cant stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.
I want him to have his uncle.
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Thats right! By his uncle too!
And by you.
And by you.
Okay Bobby, why dont we just come over here and let them have a little moment.
I had a really nice time tonight.
So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
Hi!
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
Hi!
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
Like it would help.
You are so bad!

You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?
Uh-huh.
That sounds great!
That sounds great!
Hey!
Hey!
Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You cant eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
Theres gravy?
If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thats your department now.
What are you doing?
I think I left a donut up here.
Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
Of course, you did.
Forgot something else too ya bastard!
Well, what about you?
Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?
Of course, you did.
Forgot something else too ya bastard!
Well, what about you?
Youre not feeling left out or anything are ya?
No. No, not at all, thats-thats ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Dont you?
Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Now get on out of here, you!
Hey Bob.
Hey! Hows my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, Ill ask.
Toby!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Oh then you know each other.
Were on a semi-first name basis.
What do you think of adding him to our team?
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I dont know if he has what it takes.
Really? They love him down on six.
But this is eleven. Its almost twice as hard up here.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!
A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batmans tux!
What?
Thats right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit filmthat Batman film he was in.
You cant wear that! Im wearing the famous tux! James Bonds tux!
So?
SoIf you wear that youll make mine less special.
Sorry, I just dont like the idea of when I say "I do," hes thinking, "Yeah, Id do her too!"
Well then we still have a problem.
Yeah!
Yeah!
With what?
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
With what?
Well, were trying to find someone to perform our wedding and theyre all either boring or annoying or yknow, cant stop staring at the ladies.
Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, were getting
No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
No! No! Its-its uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
I call it!!
What?! No! It was my idea!
Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Really?
I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why.
Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldnt sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.
Yeah, I wouldve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
What?!?!
Okay, this is what Im talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
You can spill. In the sink.
Aw, honey its not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I dont see that happening.
I love you, too.
Aww, good.  What?
What? Im just said.
No youre not, youre wondering which cushion it is.
Oh my God! Are you serious?!
Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you Ross.. thats-thats great! Thank you!
Well, Im-Im just glad I could, yknow, help you out.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me!
I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless.
You just saved me!
Youre my hero!
Hero, I uh, I dont knowwell, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!
Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?
Oh please!   Youre gonna say things now, arent ya?
No.
No, I wont.
But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise.
She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnt love her, but he really did, and it just blew up!
...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.
Me?
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?
That's great.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
That's it?
Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
Ok, you weren't there.
Wow! Thats ah, thats pretty nice!
Pretty nice?
Pretty nice?
Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
Youll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
We dont have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weve got a canoe.
Y'know, I, I really dont think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Were not throwing it away! I built that canoe!

Okay. Then I guess its just, wait here then.   Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
Im sorry sir, I dont understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you travelling with a child?
No.
All right, yknow what, shes  gonna think that Im handing you a credit card, but what Im really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Okay, but this is the last time.
With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there.
Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Hey.
Hey.
Hows she doing?
She?
Well yeah, dont-dont you think its a she?
I dont know.  I cant tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Well, anyway, I got to go change, Im ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?
What?
Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Yeah.
Oh sure, go with the sissy.
Jason is not a sissy!
Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
Well sensitive is important, pick him.
Yeah.
So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Yeah.
Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesnt matter.
I mean, I think it wouldve happened either way.
I mean if you hadnt initiated it I-I-I know I wouldve.
It was an amazing night.
It was. It was an amazing night.
You think it looked amazing?
Do we have a name yet?
No, not yet.
Thats fine, for now well just call her Baby Girl Green.
Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Hello baby girl.
Ah-ha, nowhere to run!

Really?
Yeah! Look!
Ive never lived like this before.
I know.
All right, dont waste it, I mean its still food.
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen    Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support    you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so
Also so
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!
Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely    gay stuff!
OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
About what?
He's planning your birthday party.
Oh my God! I love him!
You'd better act surprised.
You'd better act surprised.
About what?
Well, he didn't tell me.
Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Yuh-huh!
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo.
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
Looks like I was second to last.
About what?
My surprise party!
What surprise party?
Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
No, you are not. We tell you stuff.

I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.
Looks like I was second to last.
Chandler, we still havent gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thats because I didnt send him an invitation.
Chandler! Hes your father.  he should be at the wedding.
I dont even know the man. Okay? Were not that close. I havent seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasnt even asked?!
Its not like we run in the same circles.
I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
Its not like we run in the same circles.
I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
So what! As long as hes not wearing a white dress and a veil I dont care.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Hello! Whos in there?
How ya doin?

No-no, Rachel, dont get it! He cant see us!

Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anywayumm, what is this book about?
Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?
Y'know what, actually  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know?
Y'know what I mean, like dubbies?
And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!"
But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.

Its 6:00.
Its 6:00.
Hi!
Handling it?
What do you mean, handling it?
Theres nothing to handle.
Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnt for me and Joshua.
Yknow, theyre not gonna get married anyway!
What?
Come on!
They rushed into this thing so fast its ridiculous!
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what theyve done and theyre call the whole thing off.
Im telling ya, youre gonna be dancing at my wedding before youre dancing at theres.
Hi!
Yeah, Rach, I think youre handling that really well.
Handling it?

My drinking?
Oh, I mustve said that after you left.
Said what? Exactly.
That you enjoyed the occasional drinking binge.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Im leaving! You are just a horrible person!
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!!
If youre gonna get all sensitive about it!
I dont want to lose you.
What if I, create a position for you?
Ill make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
Id need an expense account.
Done!
And an assistant.
Sophie, get in here!
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh my!
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
What?
What are you talking about?!
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me.
Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some
Yep! There's always room for
Joey, how do you make
Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad

Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some
Okay. Lets bring it in.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Wait no, honey, honey throw it to me, throw it to me.
Here you go.
That almost hit me in the face.
Hey!
Hey!
Yknow Im-Im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh boy, me too!
Yknow I was thinking if we had aa big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
Thats me! Come on!
Okay.  But wait, we cant. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, were supposed to have lunch.
Well, get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Chandler!
Ill be right with you.
Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Nice to meet you too.
So, are you ready to go?
Yeah.
Chandler!
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!
Nice to meet you too.
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple.
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off!
Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Well that's not a third nipple.
No?
First of all, it's on your ass.
Well then, what is it?!
Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
I'm with Hamilton!
He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
Umm, this is great wine.
Its from FranceIn EuropeWestern Europe. Yknow umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Really?
Uh-hmmWait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking
I love hiking!

Oh. Well then shut me up.
Oh. Well then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
Let it go, Ross.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Hey, Pheebs.
Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Do you all promise?
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
Do you all promise?
Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
Hey, Pheebs.

Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him you had?
Oh thats not important. The point is, I reallyI think everythings gonna be okay.
Okay, Ive got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?
No thanks, Mom!
Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
No!
That was a test!
In a couple of hours Im gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me!
And then after that, Im gonna get so drunk, Im gonna wanna call Janice
Ohhh!!
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
No thanks, Mom!

Ahh, come on! Yknow whatyknow what, I think Im just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it will help.

Very good,  so good.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Come on! Look where you are!!
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.
Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And dont let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnt call.
I mean youd think hed be worried about me not showing up at his club.
Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!
Come on! Look where you are!!
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
You do?
You dont?  Well, thats the difference between a professional and a layman.
That and arrogance.
That and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey! How was sailing?
Wow thanks!
Joe?
Yeah!
Uh, youve had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.
Well, its just the reason that Im asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toI mean I really wanted to, but I couldnt.
There huhhmm, there-there was an incident.
Dont worry about that man, that happens.
Its happened to you?
Yeah! Once.
Well, whatd you do?
I did it anyway.
Sup? Sup dude?
Take whatever you want, just please dont hurt me.
So youre playing a little
Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!
Young! Youre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodys ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
And they knew about it?
Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just dont know what the big deal is!
The big deal is I dont want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzlebeer! Cold beer.
Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Do you always have to bring him here?
I didn't wanna leave him alone.
Alright?
We- we had our first fight this morning.
I think it has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Oh, that'd be great!
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
I didn't wanna leave him alone.
Alright?
We- we had our first fight this morning.
I think it has to do with my working late.
I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Oh, that'd be great!
Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
Check this out.
It says here that theres a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!
"Its almost as good as being there."
Its better! You cant go to a museum in your underwear!
Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
Uh, may I help you?
Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, Im the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
Look, its like I told you, theres nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Nobody sees the king!
Oh-ho-kay, Im talking to the king.
Hey! You cant go back there!
Hey! You cant go back there!
Oh my God.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh?
I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, dont have to sell those cookies anymore.
Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
Yeah.
My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, hed be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says hes gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Oh, um, I dont know if thats a good idea.
Oh. Look, just friends, I wont grope you. I promise.
No, I just I think that its too soon.
No its not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back.
Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
Its not a real game! I made it up!
Im sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
I don't know.
But I can see through your sheet.
Yeah, yeah, that's her.
But y'know what?
Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No. No. No. She lives on the
No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby.
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.
I did
Monica, betting the apartment, I dont know about this.
Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand.
Why? Do you have the answers written on there?
No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.
All right, lets do it.
All right, lets do it.
All right, gentlemen, youre up first.

Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!
No you cant.
You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
No you cant.
You dont want to be guys, youd be all hairy and wouldnt live as long.
Yknow you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around!!
Okay.
Im sorry.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year Ive only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio.
You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
Well, that shouldnt be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Pete, can I get you something else?
Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her?
I mean that aint a pretty picture in the morning, yknow what I mean.
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
I mean really, think about it.

Pete, can I get you something else?
Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if youre given em out.
Havent you and I covered that topic?
Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you.
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.
And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.
Come on, you think she should go out with me, dont you?
I mean really, think about it.
Ho-ho, I will.
Well, if that were true, Id dating my Aunt Ruth.

That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
I believe I read that somewhere!
That only is not funny, it's physically impossible!
Okay?
Depending    on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...
It's not funny!
I respectfully disagree.
I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Who cares? Nobody reads those things
You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your    page today.
I don't have a page.
Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.

Hi, here's the deal.
We lost a carseat on a bus today.
It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller.
Oh, and there was a baby in it.
He wants to talk to you again.
Hello.

So to sum up, Im Professor Geller.
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship!
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest!
Okay, you go!
My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.

I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."
And he said, "Laundry?

Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.

Somebody went to college. Wow.  What is it? Im sorry.
Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
I think its best sir.
But we really do need to find someone up here.
The work is starting to pile up.
Ive got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
Yknow what you should do, just toss em in the shedder and claim you never got em.
Thats a good one.

That's
Hey, I've been honing!
Oh, uh..

I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Hey, I've been honing!
What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh..

Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
Great, now he's waving back.
Great, now he's waving back.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can't do stuff!
What kinda stuff?
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Man, we gotta do something about that guy.
This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment.
It creeps me out!
I feel like I can't do stuff!

Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.
Its just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasnt called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Phoebe why dont you just call her? You obviously want to.
You think you know me so well.
Well, dont cha wanna?
Yeah.
Okay, well I do know you.
Thats what I said.
Well so?
I cant.
I cant.
She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was Okay, bye Pheebs gone.
Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun Ive ever had in like all my lives.
Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Nuh-uh.
Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
No.
Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?
Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?
Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.
You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
Aw, don't do that
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
Oh no, stay here well keep doing this. Ill pay you.

You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! Im gonna kill you!!
Yknow this is actually not a great time for me.
Okay! So, well just stay married.
Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Id have to talk you into this more.
What-wh-what so well just stay married forever?!
Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you?
Really?
I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.!
Its
Ohh, okay, Im sorry.
Youre right.
Yknow what?
Im asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!
And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
Oh my God!
I know, I know, I'm such an idiot.
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-

That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?
You actually broke her watch?
Barry, I'm sorry...
I am so sorry...
I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...
No real-, honey, really its fine, just g-go with Susan.
Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea.
Okay, okay, bye
So what are they doing?

Go!
What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I may play the fool at times, but Im a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wont quit.
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.
Oh God Oh, hes in there right now?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?
Uh, lets rip!

Can you    just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
You don't trust him?
I think the check in is that way.
Ahh.
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
Well theres some people who do want to marry me.
There are?
Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage?!

You got
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
I knew.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
Oh.
Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor herebut do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?
Sometime?
Maybe?
Yeah, maybe...
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
Well, I just thought itd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, youre amazing.
Oh no-no-no.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thats the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Well, yknow Im 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I dont know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are!
You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Im gonna do that.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think Im gonna see how things go with Kathy. Shes pretty cool.
Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
Could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
I think somebodys got a little crush on Casey.
How bout I fix you two up?
What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
Honey, whats the matter?
I just saw Janice.
Cause every time I see your face, I cant help but fall from grace. I know.....
Wow! This girl is good.
Okay, my next songs called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say.
I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldnt Have Left You That Way.
Wow! This girl is good.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.

Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy shes done.
Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.

Oh no, one of those look for the hidden meaning songs.
Yes, hello.
I have a question.
Umm, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a moustache.
Thank you.
No,
What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny.
So Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Ross, no! There is
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.

And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna
Okay, there was
Come on!
Oh wait, dont you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?

Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!
You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
So?!
Whoa, ah!! Were you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!
Oh right, right.
I dont believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?
Well usually...yeah!
Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice.
Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me.
Im such a jerk.
Its okay. I suppose it could happen to anyone, not anyone I know, but... By the way I can still see it.
Hmmm... this is so nice.
OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.
OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ohhh!!!!
Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat!
What?  Ow!
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.
I didn't mean
It's brilliant!
Goodbye Mike, we'll see you at the wedding, fella!

Thank you, Chandler.
Sincerely.
Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.

Thank you!
It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
Thank you!    You haven't said anything...
Actually I do have one small complaint.
Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind    of a mood-killer!
What musician?
We did?
You owe me 20 bucks.
You owe me 20 bucks.
Thank you. Thank you so much!
Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.

Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner?
What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
All right, I'm nine years old.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh my god.
Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner.
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.

Looks like a fun gang.
Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.

Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
No.  This is my red sweater.
Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orpoison? No? Just for me? Okay.
Whats going on Rach?
Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.
Whats going on Rach?
Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
Yknow, Im actually glad Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I wasnt mature enough, but Ive really grown up and think we should get back together.

Now go!
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
So you're a chef?
Im also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
Oh, really.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I havent been able to say two words to each other.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
That would be great. Thank you.
Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi.
Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
You didnt say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Boutros Boutros Gali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering....
Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun.
So you're a chef?
Oh, really.
Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?

What a sweet story.

Did that!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its easy grab tab and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?
No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial dont seem to think its that bad.
Thats because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid.

Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no, no.
What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?

Well, I like it. Here you go.
All right, look, youre not really gonna buy that are you? Dont you think youve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when Im pretending I dont know you?
Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yknow, youre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh yeah?  If youre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.

So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
What?
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else.
And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't even know me...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?
The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
Oh yeah.
Okay, forward. ForwardStop!  Okay, backStop!  Okay, forwardStop! Stop! Stop!
Okay, heres what were gonna do.

You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of his spot.
Okay?
All right, here we go.
Haul ass!!!
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain.
So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
...and live forever as a machine!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now?
You and I, we're interfacing.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.
Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
See?
See?
Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.
Oh, I should go, too.
Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
I asked him.
He's totally ok with seeing you!".
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Exactly!
And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,
Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Ok, that'll be great!
Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there.
And she was like "Oh, don't worry!
I asked him.
He's totally ok with seeing you!".
So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Ok, that'll be great!
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
That's not what we're gonna do!
Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Hello Skidmark.
Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Thats why you broke up with me?
You-you-you didnt know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
Its a nickname, Ill explain later.
Its pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Ni-chou chi-ma!
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Hi everyone.
I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before.
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
What did, what did he say?
Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know.
So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so.
Oh, great!
We couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow, hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
Okay, stop it Phoebe, youre getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was yknow, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
And did he?
Im a lady Monica, I dont kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like Ive had 10 drinks today and Ive only had six.
Oh, I havent had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.
Wow, Im never gonna have that feeling again, am I?
You sound like a guy.
No, a guy would be saying, "Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else."
Oh my God!
Im never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!
Ive been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that Id be giving up!
I mean, IIm never gonna have a first kiss again.
Youll have a last kiss.
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
Oh good, youre here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
I know Mona, just hear me out.
First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
I know Mona, just hear me out.
First of all, Im so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own.
Youre gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Focus.
Okay. UmButOkay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are
All right wheres that turkey!
Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Not now! These are my Thanksgiving pants!
No.
No!
Oh, would you look at that Monica?
I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
Okay, Im next.  Dont! Dont start another game! I said Im next! Phoebe!
Oh, Im sorry. I didnt hear you over all the winning.
Chandler! Phoebes hogging the game!
Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
Or Friday with no two pizzas!
Thats right!
Cause Im a Tribbiani!
And this is what we do!
We can eat!
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.
Anyway, it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? Its a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie!
Or Friday with no two pizzas!
All right fine! If it means that much to you! But justtheres gonna be a ton left over.
No there wont! I promise I will finish that turkey!
All right, youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
Thats right!
Cause Im a Tribbiani!
And this is what we do!
We can eat!
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Look at this!
Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Oh look! That guy's peeing!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Okay. Lets use this brush.
Okay. This stuff?
Yeah.
All right.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Okay. Lets use this brush.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Okay-Dokey
Where exactly is your zoo?
Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience.
Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Yes.
Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Even if he were... cornered?
Well I, I don't know. Why?
Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Otherwise it's just cruel.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
You're making a big mistake here.
I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.

We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...

My specimen is in the    room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.
Really helped speed the process along!
Janice!
You're not... gone?
Sid is still in his room.
I don't allow porn at home so    this is like a vacation for him.
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes    next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet...    I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
Phoebe, where's your purse?
No, no! Give it to me!
You can't have it.
Give it to me!
No
I'll go in there.
Oh yeah.
Phoebe come here
Haha!
Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
I just had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Don't say it.
...in love with you.
Really?
Sorry.
Well,fall out of it.
You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night.
Oh god, oh god.
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.
I'm Joan Collins.
Who?
Thats right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!
Uh sweetie, maybe youd be more comfortable here?
You. Like you havent done enough.
Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
Because with seahorses its the male, they carry the babies.
And then also umm, Id be far away in the sea.
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.
Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?
Oh God, get out!
Get out!!
Get out!!
Get out!
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!
Oh I know, Ive been there. I remember toward the end
Oh Phoebe, thats a great story.
Can you tell it to me when youre getting me some iced tea?
Oh God, get out!
Get out!!
Get out!!

Lets.
All right, I know! I know. Yeah, itll be okay.
Oh my God.Whats he gonna do now?
I cant watch!
Oh.
Seriously, how can you watch this?
Arent you scared?
Terrified.
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse?
Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine.
I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I
Fine! Maybe I will too!
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
MY SANDWICH?!!!
MY SANDWICH!!!!!!
Whats the matter, Pheebs?
She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
What?!
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
She knows, and she wont tell me.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
She knows, and she wont tell me.
Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
She knows, and she wont tell me.
Yeah, well, dont Aww Pheebs, that sucks! me yet.
Where ya going?
Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly.
Shes avoiding me, she doesnt want to tell me where my Father is.
She knows, and she wont tell me.
Well, shes out of town so, theres gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
Well, are any of those people here?!
Oh my God, so do I!
I knew it, wow!!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?
Ohh, so cute.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still Im-Im mad at you.
I know. Im mad at me too.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? Im kinda hungry.
Hey! Me too!
All right, stop it. Now youre just doing it to freak me out.
Ok, you can do this.
It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
Really?  My God, hes really cute.
Go for it.
Phoebe, Im engaged!
Im just saying, get his number just in case.
But no: Chandler is in an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, Im engaged.
Well you should be embarrassed.
I did, but that was really fun.
Hey.
Chandler. I sensed it was you.
What?!
Unagi. Im always aware.
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
Whats up?
I cant figure out what to make Monica.
Oh, why dont you make her one of your little jokes.
Im going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Yknow what?
Shed-shed love this.
Uh, its an exact replica of Apollo 8.
I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.
But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.
Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
He might still show up.
Oh, what are you, stupid? Its been three hours.
Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why dont you tell about your lovely wedding?
Its actually going to be just family.
Ohwaityou two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.
Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?
Well, I brought the next best thing.
Whoa!  Y'know what Katie? I gotta tell ya I-I-I-I think you are the one who is too much.
Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
You're so sweet!
Ohh, you're so sweet!
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.
Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Uhh.
You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Nah.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape, a rapist or a killer or something!
Dont you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!
I
Ooh, Ill play! Ill play!
No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
Yknow what? Im not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!
No!
Do you like car games?
Yeah, yknow the license plate game?
I
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?
I cant figure this out!
Its so hard!
Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or aah-ah!
Paper cut!
Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I dont want to tell anybody else because I dont want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, its because I trust you, youre one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadnt been on the toilet.
Me too.
Hey.
Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Oh all right.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica?

Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, we dont because we gottheother pl-place.
How rude.
How rude.
Oh, Im sorry. You wanna bite?
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What?
The ring is gone!
Ugh.
Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisAh-ha-ha!!
You lost the ring!
Youre the worst best man ever!
Dude, this isnt funny!
What am I gonna do?!
I go to bed last night, everythings cool!
I wake up this morning, the strippers gone and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper?
Of course!!
What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Dude, what am I gonna
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Well, I'm justif the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have
What-what is it, what is it?
Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!
What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!
I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone
I'm not listening to you!
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I gonna
Oh! Yay! Look! Theres a piece that doesnt have floor on it!
Hey, come on now!
All right, what are we havin?
Uhh, I dont believe in these crazy diets yknow, just everything in moderation.
Ill take those to go.  For the kids.
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldnt have said.
But believe me, thats not gonna happen today.
Understood. So, whatd you say back then?
Well, I said that I
Ha!
So you like the drums!
That's, that's great!
Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.
All right, okay, well, apparently not!
So, yay!
So you like the drums!
That's, that's great!
Yknow, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation.
All right, okay, well, apparently not!
So, yay!
Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
Tequila!!
That's fun.
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.
All right thats it, school is in session!
Im gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
All right thats it, school is in session!
My God! Is this a gym card?
Joey, please dont do that. I think its best that we just forget about it.
Thats easy for you to say, you werent almost just killed.
My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but Ive missed the last 1200 times.
So why dont you quit?
You dont think Ive tried? You think I
Who is Maria?
Oh Maria. You cant say no to her, shes like this lycra spandex covered gymtreat.
You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
No!
So youre strong enough to face her on your own?
Oh no, youll have to come.
Pheebs, I dont think anyone's mad about that.
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Anybody gonna eat that?
Pheebs!
Hey!
Listen, you know how uh, when youre wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?
Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw thathe was wearing womens underwear!
I know. They were mine.
Oh.  No! No wait, thats weird!
No, its not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
Thats weird!
Im wearing his briefs right now.
Thatskinda hot.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldnt know about that.
And! Yknow what Jake says? That womens underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, hell be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!
There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! Im thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacys.
Im just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in womens underwear!
I dont think you could ever do that.
Hey! I
Okay, whatever.
Lusts of the flesh.
What?
I dont know.  A cowboy theme?
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?
Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.
Hey!
Yowza
Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your  mouth.
Dear Lord.
I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Doesn’t she  look scared?
Y’know, I don’t really know her.
Hey!
Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my  breast?
It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen.
Do you think my nipples are  too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Doesn’t she  look scared?
It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it,  but don’t worry. It’ll happen.
Yowza
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."
Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.
The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
Pathetic mess?
I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
I'm thinkin', cha-ching!
Thanks.
Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.
You're doin' this.
No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me.

Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
"Happy birthday to you!"
Youre paying for that.
What? No-no its her birthday!
Youve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it really
You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damnit!
Damnit!
Rach? Hi!
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Oh-ho, and mine!
Rach? Hi!
Hi!
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well yeah
Oh wow!
I mean, wow!
I mean, I-I-I think shes cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Really?!
Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Oh so-so not really never.
I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.
I mean after all weve been through, I justyknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
No-no wait-wait! I cant just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
WellI only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.
Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
Its just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!
Chandler?
No look, I-Im sure that people know you exist!
Oh yeah?
Apparently, theres like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and theres only this one robot and this one guy who controls it!
I didnt know he could get me fired!
What am I going to do?
Well yknow Joey, youre a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.
No sweetie, youve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! Youve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
Thats not a bad idea.
Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.
Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.

"You wish."
Why are you yelling?
Whoa, that
Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Well Its a date.
A date?!
No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldnt schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Come on Joey, dont make me feel badly about this.
No, Im gonna!!
Thats right!
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin out with that girl!
Like-like-like I did something terrible to you!
And now Pheebs, youre doing the same thing!

And I feel like Ive conquered the business world, and I feel like Ive conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
Wow.
Theres one thing missing.
Whats that?
Its time for me to conquer the physical world.
Okay.
Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
You wanna what?!
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! Its the most intense physical competition in the world, its banned in 49 states!
What are you talking about?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, Ive even had my own octagon training ring designed.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah.
Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.
Okay to come in?
Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
What?!
Im the ruptured spleen.
Why would you do that?
Because you shouldnt be with him.  You should be with me.
Really?
When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me!
Look, things like last night they dont just happen.
Or at least not to me.
Or with the other two women, in the morning yknow I was just lying there and I couldnt wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yknow with a friend.
Chandler!
I know you probably dont want to go out with me, yknow because I make too many jokes and Ive never been in a serious relationship and I guess Im not technically a "doctor"
There was just one woman, wasnt there?
No, there were two.
Including me?
Oh yeah.
Hey!
Welcome back!
Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?
I dont know, Im still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Why?
Uh, the sex.

Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldnt go out with a guy like Chandler...
...and he couldnt let it go, and... I dont really know what happened with that either.
And then Rosss new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head.
And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I dont know what happened there either...
Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.

Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
I'm going into business people.
I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard.
I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man.

Jam.
Oh Joey don't!
It's way to hot.

Well hes probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
What? Mine arent tinted.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
I will have one.
Okay, Im not gonna have one.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
I will have one.
Okay, Im not gonna have one.
No, no, its just my tooth.
All right Ill have one.
No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I cant see him.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienists blouse.
Yes, while I was in the chair!
Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
I will have one.
Okay, Im not gonna have one.
All right Ill have one.
So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.
See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Why? Why cant you go to him?
Pheebs, come on, you didnt kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.
So whats a matter, you need a dentist? Ive got a good one.

Its, its, its just ah, a coincidence.
Well tell that to them. Oh! You cant, their dead.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend Albino Bob.
And all these people actually died?
Yes, while I was in the chair!
Thats why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, its not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Hello?
Ross.
It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that-that, thats all right. Umm, Im just glad you called.
Ross umm, theres something that Ive got to tell you, theres-theres someone else.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
So, let's go.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them  for us to leave now.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Okay, Ive got three of my five.
Three of your five, what?
Celebrities Im allowed to sleep with.
Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
Yeah, its hard okay, I only have two spots left.
All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
Eh, y'know what, shes to political, she probably wouldnt let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know shes too international, y'know shes never gonna be around.
So?
So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whos gonna be in the country like all the time.
Yeah, cause thats why you wont get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
Oh thats five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesnt she want to come out?
Yknow what I think it is?
I think youve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesnt want to leave.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
Twenty-one hours, youre a hero.
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Actually, I think youre ready to go to the delivery room.
What?
Ten centimeters, youre about to become a mom.
My God. Okay.  Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
Are they here yet?
No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Hi.
May I see your boarding pass?
Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
No, I know, but Ihe just went on.
He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
No no no! Federal regulations!
OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is
Alright. What's the message?
Uh... I don't know.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
What?
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about!
There's no Rachel!
Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.
I'm like the bing, bing, bing.
You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.
Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
Here's the thing, Janice.
You know, I mean, it's like we're different.

Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
I'm fine.
All right.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.
Wait here. Breathe.
How do you do that?
It's like a gift.
We should always always break up together.
Oh, I'd like that.
You win.
Well, what did you have?
It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six.
That my friend is D-Cup.
Okay, now much have you won so far?
Uh,  wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?
Yeah.
Double it!
What?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
Really?
Hey, I didnt make up the rules.
Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card.
Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500.
Dont get to excited because thats not gonna happen unless you getNo way!
Really Mr. Geller, you dont have to do this.
Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!
Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!

In that, um, they don't.
Oh. They don't.
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.
They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.
They just think you're a little...
What?
Intense and creepy.
You got me.
Yeah. Right.
Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?

Yeah, its the new building on Avenue A.

Stupid closet full of bugs!

Oh yeah! With who?
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?
Not her.
Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I cant decide between the two of them.
Yknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though shes a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun.
But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown.
Yknow shes, well shes-shes just as pretty, I guess shes smart, shes
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yknow?
She lives so close.
And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasif she was kidding was very funny.

Its one more thing in my life thats suddenly completely different.
This is hard.
Yeah I know.
On the other hand in um, in about seven months youre gonna have something that youre gonna love more than any guy youve ever gone out with.
Just wait.
Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
You have no idea.
Thanks sweetie.
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?

He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Wow!
Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
So Its really just about the math.
Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway.  Like for clubbing.
It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.
I know its a little sudden, and its a little rushed, and its totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesnt mean I cant.
Right?
I mean Im-Im crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
I know.  I need more pie.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
No, that was my way of telling you.
Well, it turns out hes incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints.
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
Yeah, well hed prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now sos Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know?
So Its really just about the math.
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
Ok, look! Enough is enough!
No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Monica, that was also true an
I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
You knew this about me when you married me!
You agreed to take me in sickness and in health.
Well, this is my sickness!
Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! How come we didnt cross paths?
Yeah well thats because uhI stayed in my room. Yeah, you dont want to look in my hamper.
I cant believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Wait! Wait! Maybe shes a hooker
Yeah, okay lets leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
So.
So.
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit.
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Oh my god, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.
Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
All right, Julie.
Bye.
Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, thats uh, thats pretty nice but Im gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Its over!
What?
Some guy bought it. Im sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!
They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, Im sorry! But yknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.
It was the ring!
No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her.
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend.
Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
We can, we can go to Aruba!
When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice.
You would've liked it.
I had a bra.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
What?!
No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

You would've liked it.
Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.
Oh that's an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm outta here!
I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
So were done then!
What?!
A small puff of air, now come on!
So were done then!
Almost! But first, we gotta start.
This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.
Sit down.
Okay.
But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
What?!
Sure, now Im scared.
No, we can go together! Just dont wait too long though, okay? Cause Im outta here sometime before Friday.
Yeah, but I dont wanna die!
No-no, itll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.
Oh, hey.
Oh, hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Youve have lipstick right here . Thats okay, its mine, we just kissed.
Hey!
Hey!
No. Y'know how were always saying we need a place for the mail.
Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
Youre building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. Its a one day job, max.
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.
Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valentes.
Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Hi!
Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
So just bring it back downstairs, whats the problem?
I cant seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
Well Ive forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake.
It was fine.
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling  Wow!
My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
Yknow what? Forget it!
Yeah and well drop it off downstairs so that were not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Mommas Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
This ones from me.
Ahh!
It wasnt on your list, but hopefully youll think its really fun.
A scooter!
Okay.
Happy birthday Grandma!
Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
All our love Monica and Chandler.
Thats funny, yeah!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.
Thats why its so funny.
A scooter!
Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.

All our love Monica and Chandler.
Thats funny, yeah!
No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
No, I know! I get it! Its funny!
No, because youre not a grandmother!
No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.
Thats why its so funny.
Okay.
Now that youre a couple, we dont get two presents from you guys?
Okay.
Happy birthday Grandma!
Its better to be over the hill  then buried under it.
All our love Monica and Chandler.

You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
What? Hes gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!
Hi!
Im so glad you could make it.
Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Shes still mad.
Yeah I know. Isnt it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
Phoebe, Sandras mad at you too. It-it doesnt bother you?
Yes, thank you so much. And again, were so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Try. Theres my little girl.
Shes still mad.
Oh, thats veryReally very-very okay.
Julies cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, thats about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
No, I dont think well be doing that.
Were not gonna do that.
Uh yes! Thank you.
Oh. Oh wait no.
Later.
Were not gonna do that.
Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
Well, if you like you can feel Rachels and then feel mine to compare.
Am I interrupting?
Am I interrupting?
Uh yes! Thank you.
Oh uh, Im sorry.
No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
Try feeding her again.
I already fed her.
I know, that’s why I said again!
I know, that’s why I said again!
Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants.
Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?   That’s just what she wants.
Hey.
Phoebe! Rachel! Its Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.
Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
Ugh
Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!
No, what did, that was really sweet.
And it kinda works out for the best.
What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!
Surprise
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you dont have either.
We ruined everything.
Ugh
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
You al-you already had it?
Well, we called everyone in your phone book and a bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Well no, wait a minute, thats not true!
No, what did, that was really sweet.
And it kinda works out for the best.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love!
I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I dont even like!
Surprise
Surprise
Monica.
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
Not you guys.
You got it going on!
So, what are we gonna do today?
... Phoebe...?
... and...?
I clunked your heads together!
So, what are we gonna do today?
They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
Ping pong?  Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
I don't think so!
Why not?
Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
I'm not always that bad!
Oh,
I punched you...?
And...?
... Phoebe...?
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
Oh, thats okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey!
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Ohh. What is this?
No Phoebe, dont look! You dont want to see whats under there!!
Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
Hey!
I tried to reach you at work. Theres....been a fire.
What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Well, the giraffes okay. And so is the pirate.
Ohh. What is this?
Hey! How long until Petes fight?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now theyre interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
Hot dog?
Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
Four, please.  Im really nervous.  Thank you.
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
I gotta tell you, I-I wasnt expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasnt expecting to like anyone right now, but shes really terrific.
Ohh, thats too bad!
No, I-Im saying I liked her.
Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Pheebs, I think shes great. Okay? Were going out again.
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Nine times!
Okay, I had to put on lotion!
But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Hey! Which ones my turkey burger?
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times!
Okay, I had to put on lotion!
But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Hey, the fights starting!
Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times!
Okay, I had to put on lotion!
But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Fights over!
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnt want to get married?
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother.
Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
Hi guys!
Hey!
What are you up too?
Yeah, Big Brother.
Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Okay well thats good to know.
The Mr. Bowmonts here!!!
What are you up too?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin about uh, websites.
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh
Okay well thats good to know.
Oh thats great, my friend Joeys in the movie business.
Yknow who I ran into from school? Howie.
My friends name is Joey.
Apparently Howies editing now.
Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Can you believe that?!
Yknow I-I-I havent spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, Ive always hated that Howie.
No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?
Yeah!
Refill?
Hey! How you doing?
Good! Good, long time no see.
Like your sweater.
Oh hey, right back at ya.
Oh, its crazy about Rachel huh?
Yeah. SheWell, shes one crazy lady?
So whose is it?
Umm, I dont some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.
Okay.
He is so weird.
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Yeah!
You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't    get it out of my head!
And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Who, who are they?
I know them from work.
Both of them?
No, one of them...
Which one?
I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.
All right, all right, you're right
What the hell are you cooking!
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
Fire alarm?  Oh! Hi, officerfireman, can-can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
Thats not mine.
Yes it is.
How do you know?
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, dont wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Okay do youOkay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
Please reattach this, its against the law to disconnect them.
Fine!  But please God.. tell me how to stop them from going off!
Theres a reset button under the plastic cover.
Theres a reset button?!
My God!
Why didnt I see that!
Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button?
Oh here it is!
Oh!
Ohh, God!
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".
Ring dammit, ring!
Thanks.
Thanks.
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!
Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please.
"Heating device."
Hey, you know our phone's not working?
What?!
I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer.
I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!
Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?
Nngghhh!!!!!!!

Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.

Rdtor.
Yeah, is Sidney there?  Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman.
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
Well, how long do you think it'll be?
Any minute now.
Hey.
Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
Ooh, its probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Im kinda.
"Benefits lapsed."
Hmm thats weird. I dont remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, its not a check. Theyre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnt work enough last year.
Let me see that!
All right.
Oh, I cant believe this!
This sucks!
When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yknow?
And it wouldnt matter.
Now I gotta be careful?
Im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stop catching on fire.
All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Im gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
look both ways before you cross the street.
I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
No.
That's all right.
Okay.
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Hi.
Hi.
Mmm.
Mmm.
So how'd it go?
Did he mention us?
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
He said he's really gonna miss you guys.
You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.
...love you.
Are you're hands still wet?
Are you're hands still wet?
Uh, moist, yeah.
Uh, moist, yeah.
Let's dry 'em again.
Oh my God! Oh my God!!
Still crying?
Like a
Yknow, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
Whats the other one?
I dont know, Ive never had to use the other one.
Im just saying yknow, if were having sex, hes not gonna be talking.
Oh thats right.
Youre the talker.
Anyway uh, great idea!
Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Oh, we have some
No you dont!
Yeah, what town are we near?
Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route were on?
Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Okay.  We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay.  There is no Route 27.   Okay, either 93 or 76?
I dont know, Im sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
Okay!
Yeah, no they dont do that.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
But if...
No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Who?
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?
Okay!
Yeah, no they dont do that.
Who?
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?
I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.
So the going for help went well?
Im telling you man, I saw it.
Yeah, well, youre wrong! Okay, youre wrong.
Im not wrong! I wish I was. Im sorry. Bet that barium enema doesnt sound so bad now, huh?
Were gonna find love!
Definitely!
Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
What do you mean?
Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.
You mean a backup?
Exactly!
Yeah, yeah I got that.
You do?
Hm-mmm
Who?
Yeah!
Are you serious?!
Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Wh So If neither of you are married by the time youre 40, youre gonna marry Joey.
Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh, seriously?
Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.
Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
Oh, seriously?
Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
Yeah, Im sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
Yeah!
Good morning.
Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
Ohh thats nice.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Well kinda old, like 30.
Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
Thats great! Wow man, so Joey mustve really taught you some stuff huh?
A little.
Yeah?
How you doin?
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
I know.
I know.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
What did you just say?
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!
Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
What do you say?
Okay!
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Here it is! Here it is!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.
Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it!
What do you say?
Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Okay! That's a four! And where-where's the other one?
It went under the table.

Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!
Well thats it. Im done. Whew!  There come the meat sweats.
Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Yeah, you want some?
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
A little bigger.
Little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
Cut me a real piece!
Well Joey, were allwere all very proud of you.
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Is there anything we can do for you?
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
A little bigger.
Little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
Cut me a real piece!
No just, nobody press on my stomach.
You can keep those pants by the way.
Whoaheywh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.
A little bigger.
Little bigger.
What?!
Are you afraid youre gonna run out?!
Cut me a real piece!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you, its pretty urgent. Its about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God!
Of course, of course.
Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment?
Umm, do you know each others hometowns?
Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?
Well, umm, not much.
But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing..Why?
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
Oh yeah it is! Im going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, Im sorry. Im so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
Look, look, theres got to be a way we can work past this.
Okay,  I cant imagine, I cant imagine my life without you.
Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart.
Your good heart Rach,  and, and....
No.
I cant, youre a totally different person to me now.
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.
God, and now I just cant stop picturing with her, I cant,  it doesnt matter what you say, or what you do, Ross.
Its just changed, everything.
Forever.
Yeah, but this cant be it, I mean.
Then how come it is?
Windows are clean, candels are lit.
Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt.
Did I turn the fish?
No, cause I made lasagne.
Am I out of control?
Just a touch.
Mon, I don't understand.
I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms?
I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
What?
Could tonight be the Night?
I don't know.
Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know.
Things happen, and they happen.
You don't plan these things.
So, did you shave your legs?
Yeah.
Ross!
Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Hi!
Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Uh-oh.
Is there a problem?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.
But that's okay, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?
Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!
All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay. Let's do it again.
Okay.
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look!  Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato.
But that's okay, no problem.
No problem.
Hmm, noodle soup.
Okay.
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!
COME ON!!!!
COME ON!!!!
Y'know what? We need to move on.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
Yeah?
Give her some money.
I really think theyre out of rooms.
Theyre not!! Ross, theyre just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.
Okay.
Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
Yknow what?
Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!
Oh gosh!
What-what?
Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Well then wed be in a lot of trouble, you dont know where any countries are.
Okay.
Uh, say would you umm Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have  opened up?
This is a hospital.
This is a hospital.
Yknow what?
Id have to say I really dont care for your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem toWhoa!
Oh gosh!
Ow! Ow! Contraction.  Ow-ow! Ow-ow!
Would you like to see a semi-private room?
Yeah, it couldnt hurt to look.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
That's funny. Who are they?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
You mean they're lovers.
If you wanna put a label on it.
Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
Okay, quick and painful.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
Oh, what? What-what?
Y'know Marcel?
...Yeah?
Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
Hi Pheebs!
Hi!
How are ya?
Good.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guys cell phone?
Yeah.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
Yeah!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
Ooh, now you lost me.
You stole the phone!
No I didnt!
No? So youre saying that if I called it, it wouldnt ring?
No. Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.  Oh, it does work!
Phoebe!
Its not here.
Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why dont you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I have left them in the copy room?
I dont know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? Its not a perfect world! Just go please.
Fine.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
This will be your phone.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
Well, here's your phone doctor.
Hey guys.
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean youre going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Well, hes very charming.
I know, hes too charming, but if you two start going out, then its just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Well, youre just gonna have to try.

Oh yeah right there!
You want it there? You take it there baby!

I talk to you and its nothin.
You look at me, and nothin.
Nothing.

No. We were in the middle of sexand
Nooo! No, thats not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!
Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.

It's just my knitting that's all!  Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.

Yeah,  oh, but oh...
Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Destiny.
Sure.
Yes.
All right.
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesnt look very fulfilled.
Oh, thats, thats ah, one of the old ones, hes just taking it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old guys?
Well, they go into the chipper.
Why, do I have a feeling thats not as happy as it sounds?  No! Nooooo!!!
Hey! Hey!!
Light still out?
Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
Oh please, they're having sex.
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
Oh please, they're having sex.
Shut up!
So, whaddya think George is like?
I think he's shy.
Yeah?
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
Hi! Hi, Im Ross, you dont know me, but Im a big, big fan of yours. I mean,
Arent you with that girl over there?
Well, yeah, kinda.
Um, but thats okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people,  so Im allowed to sleep with you.
No, no, no, its flattery.
Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella.
Dont, dont just dismiss this so fast.
I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
Um, yeah.
May I see it?
Um, no.
Come on!
But, okay.
Im not on the list!
Um, see, but thats not the final draft.
Its laminated!
Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler  brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
Y'know its ironic...
...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
Were just gonna be friends.
Get out of here you lurker!  Go on! Get!
Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You made up!
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Ohh, get a room.
Ohh! You made up!
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Ohh, get a room.
We have one.
I know. Use it.
Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Yeah, she couldn't live without the Chan Love.
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask!
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And Im one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
Well, yknow its none of my business, but arent you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Yknow I just wish we could be like on a break!
Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.
Good-bye.
Whoa!
Uh, that was your sister actually.
She-she thinks that youre just using me.
So thats the only reason she could be here huh?
It couldnt have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Im a good listener and I uh I put on a
I think I can take care of myself, Ill talk to you later.
Good-bye.
Whoa!
Uh, that was your sister actually.
She-she thinks that youre just using me.
So?
Im sorry.
What are you doing here?!
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
What?!
Umm, okay, okay, look.
I took this picture from your fridge.
Okay, because I know that this is my Father.
Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him.
Now, look I deserve to know where I came from.
All right?
So if you can help me find my Father then you should!
Otherwise, youre just mean!
So, just tell me the truth!
All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?
No, no, thats just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year!
And Im very sorry, but I dont know where your Father is, and thats the truth.
Oh.
But umm, youre right.
I think that a person should know where they come from.
Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay.
Im your mother.
Heh?
Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
Whats happening to your accent?
Come again?
Whats-whats this nonsense?
All right, Im-Im not English.
Im from Long Island.
I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out.
Im sorry.
So, if we could just get back to the lecture.
Umm, were there any questions?
About paleontology.
All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I screwed up.
But what you guys think of me is really important because Im-Im hoping to get a permanent job here.
So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression
Come again?
Whats-whats this nonsense?

Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am
Well, hello Rachel!
Where you going, Joe?
For a walk.
Oh. You mind if I join you?
Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize    my thoughts.
Your thoughts? Plural?
Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny,    I gotta see her!
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her??
You guys are killing me!
She's forbidden fruit!
It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.
Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against    the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
Great novels?
Fine ... mediocre porn
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.
Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Thats kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty is kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her,
Got it!
Lets roll!
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but were gonna have to get into Mr. Zelners office.
Now, he doesnt get in until 10, so hes no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
Lets roll!
Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anythingminute. Okay. Fine.  Abort the plan, abort the plan.
Uh actually, Id like to speak with both of you.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Oh! No problem! I
What?
You are iron.
You are steel!
Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
I told you, were adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Okay, that doesnt help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chips motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now hes-hes called me up and asked me out.
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
I-I owe her this.
I never let her eat.
Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!
Yeah. Just, if its possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
Ill try.
Ross, get over it! Its not like she hates you.
Yeah but
Ross, shes not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
Huh. Yknow whats not one of a kind? A twin!
Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!
Ooh, Phoebes here! Okay, lets turn out all the lights and well just watch the movie!
Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!
Sure!
He got it a flea market!
You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Okay. HeyOoh, cool sheets!
Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
Sure!
And Joey?
How do you think she's doing?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Thank you!
Thank you!
Now that Rachel's gone?
So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
Oh, god help us.
What?
Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
What do you mean?
Carol our sex life isits just not working

Hey, why dont you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room!

Well I dont know umm,  what if we were too tie each other up?
Umm, some people eat stuff off one another.
Nah!
Umm, yknow we-we could try dirty talk?
Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
I love that idea!

You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
Yeah.
Okay.  Every time.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?
Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Almost never.
Got the keys?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!

Hi uh, Im Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect Id like to donate some fluids.
Were actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so were not looking for applicants right now.
Oh thats too bad. Ive kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure theres no studies I can participate in?
Well, heres a schedule of whats coming up.
Thanks.  Well but this one starts now.
Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. Its a twins study.
But its $2,000.
Sorry.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
We already got the results back on that on, and theyre not good.
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it has! I made cookies!
Oh thats all right. Im still full from your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because theyre hot from the oven.
Okay.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Cant eat em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
Okay, Ill be out in a second.
Okay!
What are you doing?
That doesnt lock does it?

If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms.
Theyve been taping those people up there all day.
Right.
Hey, whatd you guys do to get up on there?
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that?
Right.

Thats it, feel the rhythm. Thats better.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Okay, youre dancing with that girl over there.

Really, ythink so? I dont..
Why arent you home yet?!
Is someone there?

Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you werent looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didnt tell him that, though? Right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You dont tell the guy that!
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateoh, hes so gonna get the wrong idea.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.

Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is.
Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
Oh my god.

Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
Come on, they're close.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?
All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Oh!
Ow!
I'm outta here.
Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?
Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.

Theres no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yknow?
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnt think I was yknow, all dead inside.
Oh thats so sweet! Look Chandler I dont care if you cant cry, I love you.
Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!
No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, were up at the altar and Im like this.
I wont care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
Yeah?
Of course he is!
What, do you think Id just use my son as-as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
All right, sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
Well, either that or uh

Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!!
Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something mightve happened to a huge chunk of it.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!
Yeah, and theyve been coming by all day. They love it!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! Ive gotta go make more!!

I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
Yeah, isn't he?
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
Huh. That's nice.
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that shouldve just lasted just one day, burned for
Eight whole days.
Thats right, and thats why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Awesome!

Yeah?
My favorite part was when
The Armadillo was actually not so

Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Cause youre still into Monica.
So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Wow! Thats exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
What?
Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?
Why would you say that?
Cause youre still into Monica.
So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Youre good. Youre good!
Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?
Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Thanks a lot.
No Im serious. I mean Im intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Really?
You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Can't wait.
Do I know you?
Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Uh, wait, backstage?

Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.

Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
You blew them away!
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!
I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?
I was
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
Oh my God!  I'm your

Okay, Monica: Right foot red.

Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.
Nooo!
Hello?
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.
Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
I've got magic beans.  Never-never mind.
To the left, to the left- aww!
Ohhh... I'm fine.
Nooo!
Hello?
Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much.

Hey!
Please tell me you got the message!
What message?
The actor playing Mac couldnt do it, they needed to see you at 2 oclock.
What?! Its 6 oclock!
Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya!
I went to Rosss!
I went to the coffeehouse!
I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.
Thats what you think.
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Yes!!  Oh.
Thats what you think.
Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?
Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.
What was her name?
Nestley Toulouse.
Nestlé Toll House?
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.
Yes!!  Oh.
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
Absolutely!
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
Tell me about it!
It does sound appealing.
Oh, I never could do it.
Absolutely!
I am so on board!
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Tell me about it!
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
Oh, I never could do it.
Oh but you could.
You can.
Absolutely!
We can help each other out!
We can get--what are those--those patches!
We could be like the Patch Sisters!
I am so on board!
Rachel didn't you just light that?
Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
It does sound appealing.
Oh but you could.
You can.
Absolutely!
We can help each other out!
We can get--what are those--those patches!
We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.
Okay then!
Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
So I have a flaw!
Big deal!
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?
And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?
And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?
I mean, what the hell is that thing?
...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
Does, um, anyone wanna see?
Nooo..
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
Nooo..
Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
It's worse than the thumb!
It's worse than the thumb!
Hey, this is so unfair!
So I have a flaw!

...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
Well, I-I could live without it.
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
Oh,  "you do, do you"?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Awww! Mel Torme died.
Joey, that papers like a year old!
Aw! Does that mean the
Aw! Does that mean the
Hey.
Hey.
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
Probably?
Yeah, I don't like that word.
Kind of what probably really means.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Yeah, oh, "Your mom probably won't kill herself," yknow?
I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on "Probably!"
You gotta take care of yourselves!
In
Probably?
Yeah, I don't like that word.

Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?
Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?
Oh, Im fine.
Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.
Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!
Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.
Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.
Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
Hey. Whos that?
New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
Theyre having their baby!
Its not fair Ross we got here first!
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
Phoebe?
Yeah?
Look at that guy by the window, wow!
Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.
Oh, what is wrong with me lately?
I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.
Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yeah.
This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Really?! So this has happened to you?
Oh absolutely yeah!
Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.
Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a
Ugh!
I dont know what Im going to do!
I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?
Hey guys!
Hey
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
And the guys from work had a blast.
Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Yeah!
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!
Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Hey guys!
Hey!
I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!
And the guys from work had a blast.
Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Yeah!
And-and another one had never been to a party before, so
That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
So you might say, its a magic ring.
Ugh!
I dont know what Im going to do!
I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!
Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnt an emergency, then what is?
Hey!
Hey
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then.
No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well
That sounds fair.
Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street
Ah yeahwait a second now!
Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.
All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.
So lets decide on the spending limit
Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?
I was thinking more like a hundred.
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Hi, again.
Hey!
You want some help with that?
Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!
Whoa! Are you okay?
Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.
Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?
Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
What do you mean?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Thank you soo, much.
Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
You want some help with that?
Oh!
Hey, somebody left their keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Hey Gunther, these yours?
Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh!
Hey, somebody left their keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Hey Gunther, these yours?
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?
Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?
Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh!
Hey, somebody left their keys.
Ooohh, to a Porsche!
Hey Gunther, these yours?
Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!
You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didnt realize until I got home.
I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!
Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.

Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!
Thanks Monica!
Does that smell bother you?
What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.
I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!
Okay.
Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.
No-no, it was the candles.
Its very not good leaving candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.
Well, I have to go now.
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!
Well, I-I said yes.
What?!
Are you crazy?
You just had Ross’s baby!
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.
No, it’s worse than that.
It’s wrong.
It’s… It is bigger than  mine!
I know.
You can’t marry him!
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.
Well do you love him?
Sure.
Sure?
Yeah, I mean whatever.
Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?
No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!
Oh my God Monica!
I wanna wear this everyday.
I wanna wear this everyday.
You look so beautiful.
Im so happy for me.
Hello?
Hello?
Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.
Damnit!
I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine.
Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I
Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!
And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
Fine.
Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!
Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!
And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!
Crap!!
I gotta go!
Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?
No.
Me neither! We have to get in!
Just act like you belong.
Oh my God! Oranges!
Shh!  Nice to see you again.
Shh!  Nice to see you again.
Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
Yes, of course.
Im sorry, would you move your thumb? I cant see the seat number.
Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.
Okay!
Yknow what?
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
All I really needed was a plan.
See I wanna have three kids
Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.
You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!
Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,
Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I dont know.
Why am I not surprised?
Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!
I dont think you have much choice.
Well well see!
Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?
Yes. Yes. Just here  and there .
Dad?
Im here!
Hey!
Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.
Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.
Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories
Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven
I used to
I used to
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.
Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a
Ok, got the vent open.
Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!

You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Thank you.
Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, I realize that
Thank you.
Filing system?
Oh-oh!
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, I realize that
And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I love working with designers!
With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?
Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Filing system?
Oh-oh!
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?

Chandler, you have an assistant right?
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do?
Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.
Okay.
Or not.
Where's Chandler?
Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!
How did youknow?
How did youknow?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Hey! What's she doing back here?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...
What happened in Atlantic City?!
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
Well, Chandler and I are in a bar
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?
So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh Mon, I laughed so hard
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
Of course I am!
Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.
Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.
And-and then guess what?
The babys coming and I dont know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
Im going to the bathroom.
Okay.
Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.
It

Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
Me too!
First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me
Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
If Phoebe were my maid of honor
Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
Because then I dont have to!
Well of
Im really not deciding!
Fine!
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!
I hope its you.
Me too!
Yes!!! Oh!!
Hypothetically!
Still.
Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.
Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
Fine!
Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine
Yes!!! Oh!!
Still.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor
Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?
Well thats the best part. Umm,
Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I dont have to!
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye!
Oh god, my eye!"
I mean, it is so annoying.
Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Maybe on some level.
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.
And, a brownie!
Well, half a brownie.
Actually, its just bag.
Its been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin to feel faint so
Oh man!

Foosball, huh?
Pizza box.
Oh, a subscription to
Yeah, actually thats my roommates.

Ah yes, but hes very protective of me so youd better watch yourself.
Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?
Hm-mmm
Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.
No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.

He forgot to leave his grip size!
He didn't get the goggles!

So are you gonna tell him?
Why would I tell him?
How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
He didn't get the goggles!

Ross, ten o'clock.
No,
There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.

Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
You could do that!

It actually is in the handbook.
I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.
I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.
Wow!
What?
Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.
Stop it!

I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.
It was unbelievable!
We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...
So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her?
What are you, insane?
It's the next day!
How needy do I want to seem?

Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!

I wanted a big wheel.
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.
It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.
That was a pretty tough year.
Thats-thats great!
See?
I already feel like I know you a little better!
Thank you.
Okay, come on.
Now we can go eat.
Lets go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
Oh!
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?
Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!
Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?

Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?
Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Why? What happened to him?
Nothing, hes just really believes in that.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a
No, Im sorry.
Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Wow! You guys really dont know anything!
I know! Why dont you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
Well, okay, so whats nowgo get, go get the eggs, put em in there.
Okay, itll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.
Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.

I don't know, clean places?
Mm, yum!
It's Danny.
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
It's Danny.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?
What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
The fake kind!
The fake kind!
Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party.
Okay, great!
Okay, great!
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
You're so efficient. I love you!
Let's go!
No-no-no! We need something old!
Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work!
I don't think so.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
Here justtake this.
That's stealing!
No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh.
Okay, one thing at a time.
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
Oh, not much. I-I got a job.

Nope. Going to the
Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
No, it is me!
Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in!
Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that.
I'm- I'm Monana!
Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
What?
They've arrested Monica.
Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!
Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.
I just...
I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.
Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days"    I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
Wow. What does
No idea!
But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .

Come on! you...
No!
Oh.  Oh-oh.
Hey!  What happened to you? Why didnt you come up?
Done!
You just finished?
Well, I wanted to be thorough.
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us!
And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!
So umm, does it?
Im sorry.
Does it?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!
Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even
No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont
Are you sure?
Oh, sure! Im sure.
You got married again.
Yes.
So thats your second marriage in two years.
Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.
Why dont you tell me what happened.
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do
Oh, thats better then.
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I see. Have you considered therapy?
I think just the

Dad, that wont matter to her.
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all hers is-is, is growing new stuff!
See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?
Well, can you blame her?
Well I dont know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could

Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.

G.I. Joe
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
That, that's what's stupid.
I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers.
And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.

You really sure?
Ill call you back.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together.
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
I am
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay, so

Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?
Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Who's party is it?
A woman's
What woman?!
Chelsea.
Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet.
Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle.
So like which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be that guy?
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you.

Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
That does not sound stupid to me.
You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.

Okay,
Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?
I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Yknow, maybe its best that we never got to do it again.

Hey, Monica, wow youve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.

They made you head of the department!

Ooh, I miss dating.
Gettin all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant.
Im not gonna be able to do that for so long, and its so much fun!
I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
Hey, yknow what?
Huh?
Why dont I take you out?
What?! Joey, you dont want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
Yes I do!
And were gonna go out, were gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out

God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with    me?
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.

Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.
Kiss me.
What?
Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you    here.
I can't believe you married him.
How can I?
Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again,    or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you?
How can I accept that...
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
Kiss me.
I can't believe you married him.
But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister    in a
So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.

How can I accept that...
I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not    to kiss you right now.
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
The bigger half.
The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Little toast here, ding ding.
I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know?
So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

Hold on!
Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that Im gonna be at that airport and I hope that shell be there too!
Oh yeah, I said Rachels name, but it didnt mean anything, Okay?
Shes-shes just a friend and thats all!
Thats all!
Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I cant imagine spending my life with anyone else.
Please, promise me that youll tell her that.
All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!
All right, Ill tell her.  Come on bugger face!
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom, why dont you ever go out the bloody window!
What happened?!!
Well, I dont know!!
We fell asleep! That is all.
Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Id better go.
I think that would be best.
Yeah. All right, Ill talk to you later.
Okay. But not about this!
No! Never! Never!  Bye.
No touch! No touch!
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
What?
It’s a funny story, actually.
I kind of fell asleep  in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really  know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But only because I was up all night worried about this  meeting, ain’t that funny?
Irony?
Not a fan, alright .
See, here’s  the thing.
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go.
See, me, I  love Tulsa!
Tulsa is heaven!
Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go  there!
Chandler, I…
No no no!
Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?
Wh-why  would I when your name is Elaine?
Oh what a great picture of your son,  strapping!
That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it,  well she’s lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.
I’ll call you from Tulsa.
Hi.
Hey.
How are you?
I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
That I was not expecting.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Oh. Thanks.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing
Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
I just can't believe you're in here.
I mean, what am I gonna do without you?
Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?
Who's gonna take me to the
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.
What do you mean?
Smell familiar?
Oh no.
Oh, I am so sorry.
No me, I am so sorry...
No me, I am so sorry...
Oh my.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot.
Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
Tho?
Ohhh.
That's good, have a seat.
Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle.
You're just gonna have to be brave, ok?
Can you do that for me?
Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand?
Yes!
All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard!
Let go of my hand!
Youre gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!
Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Welllets just say
Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, middle balcony.
Youre a mean old woman.
No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!
No! Wait no! Shut upI mean dont cry! Let me get my checkbook!
Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?
Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!
Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
Look honey, you dont have to do this, okay?
Its the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
Youre loyal, youre honest, and you have integrity!
Thats the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!
That means nothing to me.  Come on!
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.
: What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! Im sorry.  Its a little old but
: No! Youre clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
Im sorry. I didntI dont come in here a lot.
: Oh yeah, of course you dont!
: Cause youre a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of
: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?
Well, why dont think of someone else for a change?
Okay, Im sorry.
Hello!
What's this?
Oh right its that girl's phone number.
Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.
It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa!
Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby!
Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
Thank you.
I dont know how any of these got opened?!
You opened them all?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!
Oh hey! You got my parents gift!
Yeah. What is that?
Well, I dont know. I think it does something to salami.
Hey! Howd it go?
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.
Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.
So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!
No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.
Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youre not gonna be alone in this.
Im not?
Listen I uh  Its a scary world out there especially if youre a single mom.
Yknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond.
So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?
Oh wow, you didnt even try to unhook my bra!
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
No, I will. Im just not up for it tonight.
Thank you.
If I cant have it you cant have it!
I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical.
Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget.
There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and
Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Keep talking.
Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because its romantic, but because I can!
I love you!
Yes!
I win again!
Ha-ha!
Thats like 500 bucks you owe me!
Whoo-ho-hoo!
$500 that is a loooot of electricity!
Whoo-ho-ho!
I gotta buy some food.
Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?
Oh yes!
Okay, get ready to owe me!
Okay.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
No! No! No! Noone can beat me.
See? Now, thats why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
Who is that?!
Dont worry, Im brave!
I am brave!
II am brave!
No-no-no-no!!
Can you tell me who is there please?
Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.

Um-hmm.

Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting.
Im sorry Joey, as long as hes here and hes conscious were still shooting.
You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?
You wouldnt happen to have a very big fork?
So I uh, I just talked to the director. Thats it, were done for the day.
Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! Youyou were wonderful.
As were you.
So I got your car, its right outside.
Oh, thank you. Youre welcome.

My boyfriend really does have good taste!
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Mm-Hm
I know that theres no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Oh my God! Look at this!
Okay, but there
I dont care! The wires have come loose in your head!
I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And did you?!
No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
But it didnt. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Hello darling.
Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
Okay, is everybody clear? Were gonna pick it upand move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? Were gonna

Oh?my Gawd, I-I understand.
I-I am so sorry, Ill go.
Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler,  you call me when this goes in the pooper.
I found my identical hand twin!
Ohh, you are
Would you stop that!
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you!
Ohh, you are
No!
But she just came up here!
That was Joey!
I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that!
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard?
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you!
Really?
Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
Okay.
Good.  I should really start wearing hats!
I mean, why should I let them meet him?
I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him.
I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
Listen.
As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing.
I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
No-no-no-no.  Hey!
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Hey sweetie.
Hey sweetie.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?
I cant tell you. Its a secret.
Secret? Married people arent supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
Awww.  But still no.
No Im serious, we should tell each other
Really? Okay, so why dont you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at
Oh no-no, I cant do that.

Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyones name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames.
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
Umm, no. No.
Yes you did! What was it?
Umm, its Cutie McPretty.
Ohh thats so sweet!
Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Im having a great time!
Yknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but its not.
I mean its not at all.

Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.
Okay, shoot.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.

No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.
Okay, what else?
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'
Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'
Hey.
How's the maniac?
How's the maniac?

Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
What are you saying I should do?
What are you saying I should do?
I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thank you, Monica.
Thank you, Monica.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!

So uh, how you doin?
There he is!
Theres our star!

Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
So then you know?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
Oh, good. Thanks.

But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Oh, its incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.

Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
They have the best stuff in there.
Comin' through. Move, move.
Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
What?
No suds, no save. Ok?
No suds, no save. Ok?
What's goin' on?
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
What's goin' on?
Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
Was your basket on top?
Yeah, but, there were no suds.
So?
Well, you know, no suds, no save.
No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that    this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Well, I think this is a great place to work!
Ok, are they listening?
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life Im doing something I actually care about.
This is the first time in my life Im doing something that Im actually good at.
I mean.
if you dont get that...
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time.
And Im happy for ya, but Im tired of having a relationship with your answering machine!
Okay, I dont know what to do anymore.

Where were you?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Oh, which museum?
No, answer his.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
Hey!
Im sorry Im late, did I miss anything?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so shed have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, Im getting back down cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She seems really great, but shes like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.
Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Oh, which museum?
No, answer his.
How can she be great if shes from Poughkeepsie?  That joke wouldve killed in Albany.
Done! I did it! Heh, whos stupid now?

Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!
So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?
Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?
Yeah.
Me neither.
Rachel.
What?!
I dont know.  Me neither.
So do you think that these picturesAre, are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, yeah, sure.
I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, shes crying out, Where are they, where are they?
Well, shes not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Yeah.
You see, now, I would date this girl.
Shes cute, shes outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire.
I mean, thats got to come in handy
Okay, Ive got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?

Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?
2:17.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?
Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!

Hey!
Hi Pheebs!
Are you moving out?
No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,
Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me.
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.
I guess you don't.
Paolo made a pass at me.
Im so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
Im not freaking out.
Why would I be freaking out?
A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun!
I mean, whats the harm in that?
Right here!
Chandler, please dont think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
Phoebe and Rachel!
So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please dont take this to mean anything, because it doesnt.
Okay.
Really?
Yes, if it really doesnt mean anything, because you know that Im just not ready
I know! I know.
Okay.
Im gonna go tell Joey that  that youre back. I was really worried about you.

Yeah, its beautiful.
I cant believe youre gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I know.
Okay look, I have an idea.
Why dont we, why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him.
And then whoever does gets the phone.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
Did I use that already today? Im sorry.
Joe.
Oh, I win! Hes got
So you dont know thats
His new girlfriend!
I cant believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
I dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
Shes saving the rest for her divorce.
And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to

Dr. Geller, theres a seat over here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Im having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
Im having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if hell sit with me.
Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yknow what I see, I see-I see division.
Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!"
Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.
Im Ross!
Im divorced, and I have a kid!
Im Andrew, and I didnt pay for this pear.
Okay, good-good for you.

Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks,
Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.
I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!

Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
That really was some of your best work.
Hm-hmm, I told you!  I cant believe that Ive only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, youre not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
Really?!
Do you wanna?
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and Ill get the furniture polish!
Oh okay. But yknow what? Be careful. Because a guy who was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.

Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Oh I, I have plans tonight.
But how about tomorrow?
Sounds great! Okay, alright, well where does this go?
You look strong, why dont I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, Ill grab this one.
By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
Oh, hello liar.
Look, I-Im really sorry I let go of the bike.
I couldve been killed I hope you know!
I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were
Well, I would love to butthe bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe.
What?!  What the hell?!
All right, yknow what?
If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then Im sorry, Im just gonna have to take it back.
What?! Why?!
Because! Because, it-it-its Itd be like you having this guitar  and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Great! Great!  Youre making the bike very happy.
Okay Ross!  Please dont die!
How could you have kept all of this from me?
I was going to tell you, but
I was going to tell you, but
But what?! You figured youd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Nor are we still together.  Can I just  Why dont we just let the machine get that?
Hey Ross. Its Joey. Theres a hooker over here and we thought maybe youd know something about it.
No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-II need to, I need to lie down.
Everything on your application looks really goodOhh!
Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh dont worry, Im not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, dont be just blurtin stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?

You can call off the roommate search!  Hi! Ill be living here.
Oh dont listen to him, hes just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I dont think hes gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
That thing was a hazard!  Im very safety conscious.
Hi.
Hey man, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
No!
For all I know, shes trying to find me but couldnt because I kept moving around.
No, from now on, Im staying in one place.
Right here.
Well, its getting late.
Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Well, its getting late.
Yeah, were gonna go.
Ugh, yknow, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Yeah, its a very large plane.

Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
Theyre not a couple!
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Well okay, so then youre fine.
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.
Okay?
So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.
Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?

Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, its me! Phoebe!
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
Wait a second! So, whats new with you?
Umm, nothing. I mean, Im getting married next week.
And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Okay.
Umm look, youre coming on a little strong.
But Im going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together.
So, why dont we just start over okay?
And you can just tell me about yourself.
All right.
Okay.
I write erotic novels, for children.
What?!
Theyre wildly unpopular.
Oh my God!
Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?
Yeah,  a Pretty Huge
All right.
So, uh, how's she doing?
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Okay, relax, relax.
We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
Oh!
...Yeah, they were gross.
Oh, you know what I loved?
Her Sweet 'n' Los.
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
How-how are you, Mom?
Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
How-how are you, Mom?
Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?

What's different?
Nothing.
Oh, maybe that's it.

Not just restaurants, from our house.

You can't!
Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.
In the hall.
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.
Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
That's a good one!

Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.

Used to work with her. Used to! Im a relative and I didnt get invited! A
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Okay, youre fine.
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
Youll see.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Well then well get wet.
Ohh. And I dont even have a date.
I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.
Really, its fine, whatever you want.
Its perfect.
And, I dont know, if it starts to rain
Well then well get wet.
Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and yknow fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and  You go.
But-but, if you dont love this, well do it in any other place at any other time.
Really, its fine, whatever you want.

Oh that.
Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! Theyre mean and theyre stupid and-and I dont want my son learning them!
Yknow what? It doesnt matter! Because it is not true!
Okay.
And if it were true, how
Ms. Monroe  Oh there you go.
Mark's a genius!
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
And before you know it, she's with him.
And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'
And he'll be all, 'Yes!'
And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'
And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'
And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
Look, don't you see what's happening here.
Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
What am I going to do?
Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.
All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
I don't know you guys.
All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'

This is what Ive got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.
Great. Great.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, Ive got you, me, and Chandler and Im gonna invite Gunther cause, well, weve been talking about this pretty loud.

Hey, yknow what, if youre gonna do that, if youre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
Oh, come on!
Chandlers funny, sophisticated, and hes very loveable, once you get to know him.
Oh well, hey, Joeys loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, hell be there.
Well, Chandler will be there for you too.

Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.
But, all right, I dontmaybe Ill just name him The Hulk.
I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!
Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.
No it's not.
No it's not.
Don't listen to your mother.
You're independent, and you always have been!
Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!

What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!
I don't wanna give up the bag.

Honey wait, Joey, Im sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
I'm not saying that you shouldnt have a bag, I justit's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.

Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
We're switching rooms again.
What? Why?
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Uh-huh.
Chandler!
This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Hey!
Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didnt think you were coming.
Oh, I wouldnt miss this.
Well, Im very glad youre here.
Oh, youre such a gentleman.  Come on! Were going to my place!
Hey!
Hey-hey.
So are guys doing okay?
So are guys doing okay?
Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Do you have a minute?
Well yeah, sure, whats up?
I got asked out twice today when I was at lunchby guys.
Oh really?!
Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
I dont think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I dont want you to feel like you cant tell me things.
Okay.
Kay.
Well
Yeah.
Id love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Yeah, shes gay.
Here you go.
Great! All right, so Ill call you later.
Great!
Great!
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
That would be Casey. Were going out tonight.
Goin out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didnt work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy. Im having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What?
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Well, Im upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.
Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
All right look, I think its time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Whos Elaine?
Can you people not see me?!
So, will you talk to him?
So, will you talk to him?

Oh, come on! Ill give you ten free
One!  No ten! You said ten! You cant take that back!
Hey!
Hi!
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
We need a porn break.

Well, so, why dont you just turn it off?
Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.

Ahh!

Yes thats right.
Why?
I tired attacking two women, did not work.
What?!
No, I mean its okay, I mean, theyre-theyre my friends.
In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Oh, no!
No-no!
No, I tired!
But I couldnt.
Thats why Im here.
Maybe we could attack them together?
That-thats a no.
What? No! No, Im not stopping. Im Red Ross!
Dude, if you go back out there, youre gonna be Dead Ross!
I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
Im gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
The Red Ross! Okay.
I dont care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
I like that.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
Huh?
One swift kick and hell back off.
All right, bad ankle, got it!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip.
Yeah.
And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnt wear a cup.
Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liams got bad knees. You hit him right and hell go down like a lamp.

Oh!  Oh by the way?
Uh-hmm.
James Brolin?
Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered hes gay.
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?!
Hello?
Hello, is Ross there?
Uh no, hes not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this Russell, Rosss divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havent heard from him, I assume hes decided to give the marriage a try.
Ross got married againNooooooo!!!!!!!!!
Oh-oh! Okay, shes kicking!
Oh!  Shes growing inside you.
Whoa!!
Oh!
Wow that was a big one.
I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
I think thats the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Oh hey you guys!
Sure, I can hang out til I have to meet ya.  What uhHow come youre not going?
I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.
And people say you dont pay attention.
No, this is a much better job.
Its vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
Thats what I do now.

Everyone knows Im an ass man!
Yeah and the most important thing is that it wont be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
Itll be me!
And I swear Ill do a really good job.
Plus, yknow I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.

Oh, Im so sorry.
Um, and maybe Im wrong!
I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more.
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him?
Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girls gotta eat.
Oh, but its made her so happy.

Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?

Oh.
Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Me too.
Although this city is my home, so.

You're driving me crazy with that!
Okay, I'll stop.
Dont stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon.
And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Uh yeah, right here.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?

But they're not here yet!
But they're not here yet!
I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Oh, god.
Here we go. Mona umm, I think its time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
Aw, we-we are so So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, yknow hanging out with you.
And I mean-Im having a lot of fun.
Okay.
I mean, theres no point in spending time with someone if-if its just fun.
Its gotta be, its gotta be going somewhere right?
So where-where is it going?
Ah!
Thats-thats the real question.
And-and the answer isis its going somewherefun.
Now I-I know what youre thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago yknow, but youre-youre not getting any younger.
No I meanNo not you, not you, youyou
Im sorry, so umm, so where are we?
Drum roll.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Youre actually going through with this?
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You got problems because of you!
Not your name!
All right, this has got to stop!
Chandler is a great name!
In factyes,  Im, Im sorry.
I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Im-Im, Im gonna, Im gonna name the baby Chandler.
Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Nah, youre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
Okay, its probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women So, as of 4 oclock tomorrow, Im either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
It was.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, thats not gonna be me, not me.
Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
No.
Whoa. That was really good.
Thanks, any suggestions?
You-youyou had sex with Ursula?!
Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
You didnt notice she was wearing different clothes?!
Well I was just so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Yknow what? This is too weird.
No-no its not!
I dont want to lose you!
Its-its like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was youYeah it is too weird.
So I guess this is it.
Yeah.  Maybe its for the best. You smell just like her.
Yeah, so do you.
Hey!
Hi.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well,
You can?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
Um-hmm.
And a small piece of chocolate.
Okay.
Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
Okay, we have to talk. Im just getting out of a very serious relationship
I know! And Im just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?
No! No! Not, Paris.
Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. Thats right, yes, Im being transferred to Yemen!
When?
I dont know exactly.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I do know that its some time tomorrow.
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, thats him! Thats him!
Great! Go get him.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
Hes not really my type.
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see whats he like. People tell doctors everything.
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
You do attract some stinkers.
Chandler.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
Oh, listen.
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.

Nothing.
Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a
Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Oh, listen.
If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them.
Really.
Nothing at all.
Really.
Nothing.
Yknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course! Joey wouldnt let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, hes surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youre moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
He may think Im sick.
Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!
Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
Thats it.
Oh, so thats this is gonna work now? Youre just gonna order me around all the time?
Pretty much.
All right.
No, no, I keep trying, yknow?
I can get out, "Joey, I have too" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "go to the bathroom."
He may think Im sick.
All right.
Hey Monica!
Yknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but I We just have to get it over with!
Yknow, the next time we see them were just gonna tell them.
Thats it.
Hey Monica!
Hi!
Hey man, you feeling any better?
Joey, we have something to tell you.
Oh my God! Youre pregnant!
Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youre only married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youre married everywhere.
Really?!
Yeah!
Oh my God!Eh! Well
You see that guy? Hes in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave hes going straight to the porn.
Hes gonna go up to the counter with
Yeah.
I missed this.
Me too.
So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Awww!
Hey, its your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
We will.
We will.
Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmellows in concentric circles.

Well, John McClane had plans!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium    in the Devonian era was top notch!
Stop going through my stuff !
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
I'm smarter than
Stop going through my stuff !
Hey!
No.
Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
I'm smarter than
Hey!
Hey!
I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna    do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Please, what about you and Chandler?
That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Well hello !
What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from?    Why don't you just kiss one of them?
I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
I'm gonna do it.
And I can't stop you.
No.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?
Dont wink at me. And put on your apron.
Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, cause Im heading up there.
Uh, yeah, Ill take a coffee. Thanks, man.
Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
Sure.  Coffee? Cause Im going up there.
No.
Just being friendly.
Joey, honey, I dont think youre supposed to go back there.
Nah, its okay. Right, Gunther?
No.
No, thank you.
No, thank you.
You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just being friendly.
Okay, but I dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, do you work here?
No.
You guys need anything, cause Im heading up there.
Id love an ice water.
You got it.
No.
Hey, waiter.
Yeah?
Youve reached Monica and Chandlers, if youre listening to this message, were probably screening.  Yeah we are.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum.
Im calling for Monica Geller.
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!  Yes, the groomNo! Not the groom!!
Thank you.
Thanks.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
So go fix it!
Go find Chandler!
He's probably up in your room!
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!
Sure!   Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Anybody lose this?
Anybody lose this?
Comin' out. Place your bet.  Dice are out.  Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
Hmm.
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yeah, its in the guys apartment under the sink. Why?
Because Im going to London.
What?! What do you mean youre going to London?
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
Now honey, you take care, you dont have those babies until I get back.
IRachel, you cant go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does.
But I have to tell him how I feel!
He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
Thats not why youre going!
Youre going because you hope hes gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget that British chippy."
OhhDo you think he will?!
No!
Because hes in love with the British chippy!
Look, Rachel, if you go, youre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding!
Yknow, its too late!
You missed youre chance!
Im sorry, I know this must be really hard, its over.
Yknow what? No. Its not over until someone says, "I do."
I do! I do! I do!  I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. Im carrying a litter.
Hey!
Hi.
Are you all right?
Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
Oh my God! He did it?
Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
Are you kidding?
I’m like the one who talked him into it.
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
And you really think this is a good idea?
I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too.  The puppet master gets tired people.
I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks  so.
Really?! Even Ross?
Especially Ross!
There he goes, your fiancée.
I guess so.
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
I can’t say that I’m surprised.
Are you kidding?
I’m like the one who talked him into it.
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Especially Ross!
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.
Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come  back later.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back.
Are you kidding?
I’m like the one who talked him into it.
I  like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll  come back.
There he goes, your fiancée.
Oh, that is so unfortunate.
What?
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
Hey, y'know while were on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you dont live here anymore.
I think on some levels she already knows.
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.
Okay, Ill be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe Im sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You didnt leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Oh, then it mustve been you. Bye.
Bye-bye!  Thats why I moved out.
Night Mon. Night Julio.
Adiós.
Adiós.
Look Julio, someone left their book here.
Ah actually, that is mine.
Oh yeah, what are you reading?
Flowers of Evil, by Beaudalire. Have you read it?
Have I read it?  No, are you enjoying it?
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
Your a poet and don't know it.
Actually I ah, I am a poet.
Oh, then you do know it.  So um what kind of things do you write about?
Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
Mine?  Right here?
I can write an epic poem about this lip.
How would that go?  Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.
What?
What?
I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.
What?
Were at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?!
Yes we are. So, coffee?
Coffee sounds great.  Wait, so, so you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But its just a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Okay, heres batch 22.
Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Lets give it a shot.
Lets give it a shot.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
Okay, heres batch 22.
Oh, maybe thesell taste a little like your grandmothers.
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.
Would she?
Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
I know honey, Im sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because its remotely related to the field theyre interested in.
Gee, I dont know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Oh honey, come on, Im sorry, I didnt....
I dont mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
Im sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
Its not funny, this is actually my job.
Oh believe me, I-I-Ive been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, so Im just going to go back to talking to my friend here.
And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Ah, just one other thing.
Yes?!
I ah, I work at
Do you want my pickle?
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Why?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Oh my God.
Phoebe.
Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
We should do something. Whistle.
We are not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.
No!
Do it!
No!
Do it do it do it!
Woo-woo!
I can't believe you did that!
Hi! Umm, Im Monica Geller, Im the chef at Alessandros.
Still?
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Spoon?  So, what do you think?
Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
I dont see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Either eat it, or be in it.
Im torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in.
Either eat it, or be in it.
Spoon?  So, what do you think?
Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here.. theres a new class comin in.
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
I can.
Okay, go ahead.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
Thats very good, whats your name?
Monica.
Monica, you go to the head of the class.
Okay.
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,    it's a place I've never seeeeen.
But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a    human spleen.
Human spleeeen.
Olé!
What are you doing here!
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street,    so I am here to entertain!
Great!
Yeah!
It really has been great too, you know, some of this people    must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs!
Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".
Listen Phoebe...
Yeah.
You know how much I love listening to your music, you know,    but...
But what?
This is kind of a classy place.
Ok, say no more.
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.
Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!

But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Look at me!
Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Maybe I should get another pair!
Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight.
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.

To kill Bob??
No, no, to test his neck strength.
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him!
I thought we were just gonna    capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can    maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.
Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
I'll find Bob, I'll get him.
Bob?
Bob!
Robert!
Oh wait, I think I hear him.
Oh - Oh my god!

Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
Suzie
Hmmm, soup!

Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection.
Joey!
What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute!
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
I said, "No!"
Which puts
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? There is no ball.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!
Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
Oh great! That
Do-do you, do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?
No-no, they're not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you.
Okay?

Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
What?
Its over.
Oh, was it awful?
I didnt even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oclock shadow on her head.
Anyway, she didnt want to stay.
I called a cab. she just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.
Its just some things Ive been thinking about.
Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Okay.  Wow, its-its 5:30 in the morning.  So, Id better get cracking on this baby.
Well, Ill be waiting for you, just come up when youre done.
Okay, Ill be up in,  18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the
All right, that Ill retract.
But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnt it.
Youre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice!
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! Im proud of that sauce, its delicious.
Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes, Im gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
How long is this gonna take? Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
Okay, then what happened?
Ohh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  You'll get your turn!
Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Nothing!   This is not over!
No! No! No!
What?!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in  Actually, thanks!
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Really?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.
Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.
That's okay, Joe.
All right, let's go Pheebs.
Oh God!
That was amazing.
I know.
Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have just started a family.
Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You cant just stare through the peep hole for three hours! Youre gonna get peep eye!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I always knew she liked him!
Y'know, shed say no, but here we are!
Right?
We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didnt just break up.
Hey, its been like three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh yeah!
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
Well, there's this one thing Okay,  here goes.
I made a promise that--Oh hey!
What?
You're nose is bleeding!
Oh God.
No!
Oh not again!
This-this happened when my grandfather died.
It's ugh!
Sorry.
Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Umm
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!
Hello, Chip.
Hello, Chip.
Hey, Rach! How ya doin?
Im great! Im great. Ive got a great job at
So ah, Monica ready yet?
Shell be out in a second. So, Chip, hows umm, Amy Welch?
Amy Welch? Wow! I havent seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
Thats right, I love you! And-and Im gonna play with you all the time.
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Ohh!
Okay!
Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Hes talking to the baby.
Ohh!
Okay!
Okay, cause when-when he said, "I cant wait to hear your first words," I thought, "Theres a trick."
Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. Ill see you later.
Okay.
Oh my, oh my God!
Aw, its unbelievable!
Wow!
She is kicking so much!
Oh, shes like ummohwhos that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Mia Hamm?
Mia Hamm!
Oh thats amazing.
Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Whoa-hey-oh! Sorry!
Okay, what do you guys think?
Dude!
You really like it?
Dude! How-how did you write this?
I stole Monicas and changed the name.
You cant
Dude!
I have never known love like this.
You cant
If he goes first he can!
I have never known love like this.
You really like it?
Yeah!
Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, yknow?
Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Oh wow thats a great idea! And
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
Here you go.
Oh wow thats a great idea! And
Here you go.
Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one.
Here you go.
Yknow, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you dont get all upset.
All the time?
All the time!
Cassie, how you-how you doin on thathot dog.
Im all done.
Thank God.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right.
Right.
Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you til you cried?
Were probably too old to do that now.
Ill always remember that summer, because its when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and Ill always remember that summer because thats when I realized that we are related.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Well Im, Im a little slow.  Just as our children would be.
Relax every muscle in your body.
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place.
Okay, tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place.
Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
All right, I'll try not to.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place.
Okay.
Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains.
And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
See you later Rach.
Bye-bye Julie.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
Hey?
What?
Can I ask you somethin'?
Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower.
Ok.
Ok.
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
What's up?
F.Y.I..
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons.
Her name is Stephanie... something.
She's supposed to be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Uh...
Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Ahh, no.
Oh.
Are you jealous?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous.
All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
And y'know, and um, I...
Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
What?
Huh.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
I'm not jealous.
All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers.
And y'know, and um, I...
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
I cant believe you came back.
Dont say anything.
I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Dont say anything.
I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Rachel! Rachel!
What?
You missed the exit!
Oh, sorry.
Dont say anything.
I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Oh, sorry.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Um,  Barry.
Dont say anything.
I dont wanna speak, I dont wanna think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
Um,  Barry.
Awwwww
I justI thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Dude!
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.
God!
All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Dear Mary-Angela.
Hi.
How?s it going.
This is the hardest letter I?ve ever had to write.
What the hell?s a matter with you?
How do you think Joey?s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
Well, that?s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I?ll be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you?ve got to do this yourself, okay in person.
At least you know her name.
You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Where in Cuba?
Hey.
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Umm, she kissed me.
What?! You kissed!
All right.
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?
A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, lets play again.  What do you got?
A four and a nine.
Youre kidding right?
No. Why?
Well thats a full cup!
Damn! I am good at Cups!
What? Why? Where are you?
Im still on the set!
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
I know! Im sorry! The guys drunk, they wont let me go until we get this.
Oh my God! Im gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, Im the minister! Alright, look-look, put em both on the phone, Ill marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Dont you hang up on me! Ill marry you and me right now! I have the power!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah, I've been around.
Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
Great! Problem solved!
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?
Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Bastard!
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Oh, I can't believe it!
I mean I think it's great!
For him.
She might be able to do better.
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
No. Joey, she
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping orOh!
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!
Oh, I can't believe it!
I mean I think it's great!
For him.
She might be able to do better.
Hey guys!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what?
It doesn't matter who knows what.
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Hey guys!
Joey! Come here! Come here!
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
No. Joey, she
Yes, but y'know what?
It doesn't matter who knows what.
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know!
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Yknow, youre friends getting married, its gotta change things.
You really think it would be that different?
How could it not be?
I mean pretty soon theyre gonna be having kids, and then theyre just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe theyre gonna have to leave the city to be near a
Well, things change.
Well, things change.
I dont want them to move to a
I dont want them to move to a
Itll be okay Joe.
Its still there!
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town. Maybe shell be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We dont want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her.
Well, we dont want that.
No, so were protecting her.
But we should take it.
But we should move quick.
Why?
Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.
I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women.
And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know?
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey, you're not him.
You're you.
When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
No.
No.
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business.
Now that wasn't easy, but you did it!
And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.
Thanks, Chandler.
Get off!
Hi.
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
And the cream?
Cheese makes me thirsty.
Okay. Lets move on.
All right.
Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
Oh! Something smells good over at Monicas station!  Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! Youve never made this before?
Oh no!
I dont know anything about cooking.
I had to ask someone what its called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
Well, hats off to the chef.
I-I-Im sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didnt hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
The chef!
Thats right.
Hey, Pheebs.
Hey.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
...No, we hate him.
Hey.
How's it going?
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
I dunno, there's just something about...
I dunno, there's just something about...
Basically we just feel that he's...
Basically we just feel that he's...
We hate that guy.
We hate that guy.
Yeah. Hate him.
...No, we hate him.
We're sorry.
Yeah. Hate him.
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
So what's going on?
We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Im sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Yes that was mine.
Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.
Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man!
All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time.
And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.
Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
She said what?
She said, "If Im not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
Postpone it?
Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?
Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?
This isnt right.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.
I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Dont you point your pants at me!
We have no choice!
Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?
This is our wedding Im talking about.
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when were getting married.
So what are you saying? Its now or never?
No. Im saying its now.
Or?
Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
Its not the pants.
Its you that is backwards.
And if, and if you dont understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnt get married at all!
No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please
Hi, honey.
See you later.
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
This is Chandler Bing! This is Chandler Bing!
NOOOO!!!!!!!!
Well next time ask! Or at least wait for me to ask!
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. Im calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!
I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if shes still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available
Oh please, he didnt hear it! He didnt hear it!!
Ma! What're you doing here?
I came to give you this  and this.
Oww! Big ring!
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?
Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Really?
But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Have you ever seen so much crap?
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap

Check this out. Can I have this?
What?
I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti.
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
Fortunately, it is me.
And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate.
Y'know, someplace nice.

So, what do you think?
I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.

So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
This place is really my Grandmothers.
I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this.
So if the landlord ever asks, Im 87 year old woman, whos afraid of her VCR.
So are you thirsty?
Oh, you bet I am!
Okay, heres your penis!
Ohh, okay.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Thank you, its my moms. So this is the kitchen.
Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
How about Mama Lisettie's?
Enh. Sure!
I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out.
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy!
Thatthis milk is mine.
I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
Okay, let's go!
Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Okay, stop!
Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Go!
Go!
Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I dont want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
No but at Monicas you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. Im sorry.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Yeah.
God, what a mess.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
Well, I lost.
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S.
Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Hey! Howd the interview go?
Oh, come here sweetie, listen, youre gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.
Thats not how that was supposed to come out.
Hey! Howd the interview go?
Oh, I blew it. I wouldnt of even hired me.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
I cant!
Its too late!
Terry already hired that girl over there.
Look at her, shes even got waitress experience.
Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin....  swans.
Well, I lost.

Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
What do we got there?
A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!

Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Thank God. Food.
Phoebe?
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
Oh God.
Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Phoebe?
What?
Do you have a plan?
I don't even have a 'pl'.
Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
And-and a power tie?
Oh God.

Big Bird's friend.
I see pizza!
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
I don't even have a 'pl'.
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
Big Bird's friend.
Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!
Hello? Who are we spying on?
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?
What?!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.

Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.

Hi, could we get two burritos to go, please?
I'm sorry.
But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like this are always shakin you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.
You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you can get us a table a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
I'm sorry.
But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it.

Okay, you hard worker! Ill remember to put that in your evaluation.
My what?
Well, youve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
But yknow, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious?
No, Ive just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
I can blow dry it.
I can put gel on it.
It doesnt matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head.
Its so annoying.
Does it bug you?
You bug me.
Is there any chance you didnt see that?
Hey Joey, what cha doing?

Okay, look Im sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldnt have, but you got porn!
Hey-hey, yknow what?
Theres nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a littleerotica.
Its just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
You got porn!
Well, I feel like a snack!
Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are.
Oh no thanks. I dont like
Oh no thanks. I dont like

Come on!
I dont wanna make any mistakes, alright?
This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?

Oh I am!

Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it cant? Okay.
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?
Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!
Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
That's not possible!
Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.
Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?
Well it's not flexed right now!
anyway, his name is Allan and weve been going out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party planner.
He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Oh well.
And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.
Oh. Oh, thats great!
Really? Like how?
Well yknow, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, wed jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so theyd put salt on their cereal.
Thats a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?
Yeah, youre funny.
Im funny?
Oh thank God!
Well hey, Ive got a ton of these!
Umm, oh hereDo you want a good one?
Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge.
Right?
And then you say to person, I bet you cant roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face.
And then when they do it, theyre left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I-I-I-Im funny Ben, but Im not stupid. Okay?
Chloe? Hi..
Is this about me taking your watch?
You took my watch?
Im sorry, I do that.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
Oh no. I feel it isnt really anybodys business, y'know.
Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Yeah. That-that was the problem.

Isnt he an architect now?
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
And people will think you own a Porsche because youre wearing the clothes?

So how was Joan?
I broke up with her.
I'm tellin' you, she leaned back; I could see her brain.
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
I broke up with her.
Dont tell me, because of the big nostril thing?
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.

It made me nuts.
