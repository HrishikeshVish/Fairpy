Today we're gonna check out Mission: Impossible two, starring Tom Cruise.

(uhh) Honestly I thought this movie sucked.

(uhh) Mission Impossible one, I thought was much better

(uhh) because it was actually (uhh) it had a good plot. It was interesting and it wasn't just there 

(uhh) to to (stutter) throw in as much action as possible. It was a a (stutter) true spy movie.

This one (uhh) is to me, pretty much ridiculous and it seems as though, they were just trying to make it as extreme as possible

and that is definitely the truth in one scene where (uhh) Tom Cruise

(uhh) is riding through some

flames on his motorcycle doing a nose wheelie and stuff like that. I mean just look at the cover.

Look at that.

That's how extreme this is. It's a little too extreme for my taste. But if you like kind of dumbed down action movies then this is for you. Otherwise, (uhh) I don't recommend this movie.
