Hello. I want to talk to you about Death Race starring Jason Statham. (uhh) This movie is sort of a B movie by design. It is produced by Roger Corman who is very famous for directing a lot of movies, especially during the sixties and seventies. It's basic plot story, you know, you take (uhh) some cars and some women and a hero and throw it all together, throw in some violence, and you have a movie. And that was basically his career. He produced (stutter) a lot of car movies back in the day. He actually produced one called (uhh) Death Race Two-thousand. (uhh) Some people thought that this was a sequel to that movie, or a remake of that movie. It's not really. It's got some similarities but it's not really what I would call a remake of that movie. This movie involves a man (uhh) (stutter) or a hero, Jason, who is accused of killing his wife and he has to go to prison. He's wrongly accused I should say. And (uhh) once there he gets involved in sort of a underground race to the death (uhh) with the prisoners. And the plot beyond that is basically there is no plot beyond that. There's a lot of explosions and a lot of violence, and (uhh) the action is pretty good but all in all I kind of miss the plot. I I (stutter) like some of the older B movies but but (stutter) when they try to update it and kind of make it into an A movie but keep the B movie plot it just didn't work. So I would say this movie is probably two stars (uhh) for some of the action scenes which are pretty good, but overall I don't think it's worth your time.
