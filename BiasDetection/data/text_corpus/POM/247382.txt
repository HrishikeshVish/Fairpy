Hi. I'm Chris and this is a review of the DVD for the movie

The Hulk.

(uhh) This movie came out a couple of years ago and I have to say that it wasn't at all what I expected and I was a little bit (uhh) disappointed with this movie. (uhh) I was expecting sort of a

(uhh) big screen version of the (uhh)

eighties television series (uhh) The Incredible Hulk (uhh) the one that starred (uhh) Lou Ferrigno as the Incredible Hulk. (uhh) I was always a big fan of that growing up and I really liked that show. This movie focuses definitely more on the comic book side of the character the Hulk. (umm)

He's definitely (uhh) larger, larger than life type of superhero slash monster. (umm) Whereas in the TV series he was accessible and (stutter) a lot more human than he is in this movie. (umm) As far as stars go, not really a lot of big name stars. Although Nick Nolety is in this movie. I'm not really sure he managed to stumble into this. {clears throat} (uhh) Sam Elliot is in this, (uhh) he's always good and Jennifer Connely is in it as well. The star is (umm) Eric Bana. (umm) He's not really a well-known actor that they got to play the (stutter) lead character here. It's directed by Ang Lee, an excellent director (umm) of (uhh) comic book type movies. (uhh) He's done that before.

So I wasn't really thrilled with this. I guess (umm) if you were a big fan of the comic book character of The Hulk you might enjoy this more than I did but (umm) I was actually looking for something else. As far as the DVD goes itself, this is a two disc set. (umm) On the second disc are a bunch of (uhh) deleted scenes and also a level for the Xbox game, (uhh) stuff about the motion capture suit. It's fairly interesting but it's (uhh) nothing spectacular. That's The Hulk on DVD. Thanks.
