I am reviewing Stephen King's The Mist and it's now currently playing in theaters. This movie was, it was okay.

I mean I like Stephen King stories

(umm) but this movie wasn't scary. Usually scary movies are filled with psychological terror and stuff, but this one was just shows you a bunch of monsters. It (uhh) the story line is basically (uhh) a mist attacks, like, an island,

a small island

and a bunch of people crowd into a grocery store to try and avoid the mist and, and (stutter) I won't spoil the end but the ending was (umm) {noise} kind of touching I guess,

but

the ending was okay. (uhh) Nicely planned, (umm) just the fact that they ended up showing all the monsters that were in the mist (umm) just made it (uhh) it it (stutter) just wasn't scary anymore. I don't know if you can call it a horror since the monsters weren't really scary. They were just basically like giant bugs and giant lobsters. (umm) But if you want a cheap laugh I guess.
