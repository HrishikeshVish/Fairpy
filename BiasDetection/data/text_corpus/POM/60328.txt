Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this (umm) dvd. It's Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. It stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. It came out some time ago in the nineteen seventies I think (umm) maybe even nineteen sixty nine. (umm) But it's a great movie.

(umm) It features (umm) real life bandits Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid that (umm) robbed railroad trains for a living. And it takes place (umm) in the eighteen hundreds. And (umm)it's just a lot of fun to watch. (umm) This movie really does still hold up today. The acting is very well done, the script and storyline was very well written and it was a wonderfully directed.

(umm) By the end of the movie you, you'll (stutter) really be caught up to see if they (umm) they make it at the end of the movie and see if they get away. (umm) But it's just a lot of fun to watch (umm) it also features a lot of bonus material on this. It features (umm) a forty-five minute long documentary with the stars and you can pick this up for about nine dollars depending on where you get it. And I would highly recommend this movie.
