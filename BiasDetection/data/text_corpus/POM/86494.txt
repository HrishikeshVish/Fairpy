Hi, I'm Marshall Hammer 

and I'd like to review 

Live from Baghdad 

starring Michael Keaton and Helena Bonhma-Carter. 

Now this movie I think is timeless 

because (umm) 

it has to do with war and bombings and 

we're becoming more and more familiar with that type of action 

in our country today. 

Now Helena Bonham-Carter 

is, I'm a huge fan of hers and she's excellent in this film, 

as well as Michael Keaton I 

think this is probably 

the number one thing that I've seen him in. 

(uhh) 

Ebert and Roeper gave this two thumbs up and I would give this a five on the rating scale of Expo TV. 

So (uhh) I really think you should check it out. 

It's based on a true story 

(umm) 

by CNN or involving CNN in nineteen ninety. 

When a news team went over to 

Baghdad to get some footage. 

And (uhh) their lives 

got into great danger. 

So check it out, 

I give it a five, 

Live from Baghdad starring Michael Keaton 

and Helena Bonham-Carter.
