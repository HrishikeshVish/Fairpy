Hi this Matt movie review for Momma Mia this movie is pretty much a movie all about Abba, their songs and starring Meryl Streep and and (stutter) I don't know, I don't know why I thought this movie would be interesting, I didn't realize I didn't see the preview to the movie I heard that it had the songs in there I thought well this will be interesting

and I don't like musicals so this was hard for me to watch and one big problem with it is

the actors are singing the songs and you know their voice aren't the best (umm) Meryl Streep she does a pretty good job actually she doesn't act very good in this movie, her acting's like so so, and her singing was pretty good, couple of songs pretty good (umm)

so you you (stutter) might enjoy this if you like musicals (uhh) I know a lot of people did enjoy this and they really were excited about seeing this and actually wanna see this again for me I wouldn't want to see this again (umm)

I didn't really like the movie, and I thought they could've I thought Meryl Streep could been done could been done a lot better at this (umm) Pierce Brosnan is actually in this movie too and he sings horribly when (stutter) he comes up the scenes that he sings, just just (stutter) close your ears

run away it's it's bad. (umm) But, so I can't recommend this movie to anybody, but than I don't like musicals so you take that as you want (umm) but that's Momma Mia,

have fun watching it.
