This is The Twelve Kingdoms Collection Two and this was really sad. It's a premium box edition where you got all the, all the (stutter) discs and their (umm) disc covers but (uhh) this has been collected into a nice little package here {noise}

in in (stutter) the economy collection. And you can see how the discs are arranged. They are the original

ones that they put out on DVD so

you're getting all the features and everything that was originally there on the individual releases. And this continues the story of (uhh) Youko who was a young girl that (uhh) found herself (uhh) into an alternate world and (umm)

she ends up (uhh) 

getting caught into this fantastic destiny in this fantasy land and (uhh) some people have (umm) compared this to Fushigi Yugi except they said this is the good version of Fushigi Yugi cause it doesn't have a character that's quite as annoying as (uhh) Miss Miaka was in, in (stutter) that particular show. But this is beautifully animated. If you did enjoy Fushigi Yugi you are most likely going to love this cause there's a lot of political intrigue, there's all kinds of betrayals going on, there's romance. I mean this has absolutely everything that you would want into an anime. Action scenes, it's it's (stutter) everything wrapped up in one. And this is the (umm)

the final part that's been animated 

plus five volumes further and this (uhh) second collection. And (uhh) this pretty much finishes up everything that's been animated from the Twelve Kingdoms so far. It was a series of books in Japan and they did not animate the entire thing but it does have a (uhh) decent conclusion. So I wouldn't worry too much about that, it's definitely worth the ride and you do get to see enough of the story to make it worthwhile. So five out of five stars for this (umm) collection of the Twelve Kingdoms, collection number two. And it retails for about thirty-nine ninety-nine which is a steal for five DVDs.

 And there you have it.
