Hello, Will here 

and today I'll be reviewing 

Charlie's Angels. (uhh) This is not the full throttle version, this is the first one. 

And 

it's pretty good. 

I wouldn't go out and say, you know, go out of your way and buy it, 

but

if you like (uhh) Drew Barrymore and Carmen Diaz's acting, 

and Lucy Liu, 

go out and buy it. Otherwise it's not really worth the price. 

(umm) 

It was okay. 

It didn't really (umm) 

reflect the series 

as well as everyone thought it should have, if you're a fan of the

Charlie's Angels TV series. I mean,

the the (stutter) people elements are there, it's just 

not really the same, 

so (umm) 

I don't know, 

with special features and all I would say you know, 

don't go out and get it. (umm) If you're going go out and get 

you know, you get this one and full throttle which is the second Charlie's Angels 

(umm) together

for cheap, go ahead but 

don't bother. 

All right.
