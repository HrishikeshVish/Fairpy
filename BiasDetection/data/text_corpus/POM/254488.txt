Hi my name is Anaj and today I'm reviewing the dvd of the movie The Silence of the Lambs and this is the widescreen edition and this movie stars Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. And in fact this movie it won about like five (uhh) academy awards it's (uhh) including the best director and the best picture awards, so it's it's (stutter) a supposed really good movie. Now the story is that there's this (uhh) psychopath (uhh) I think his name is Buffalo Bill or something, and he's killing women throughout the region. And the FBI really wants to find this guy and Anthony Hopkins is in the prison and he's the kind of a (uhh) psychic person, not not (stutter) a psychic person he's he's (stutter) like crazy he's totally crazy but he's a very smart guy. And FBI chooses Jodie Foster who is also FBI agent to go and talk to Anthony (stutter) Hopkins. And (uhh) the best scenes in this movie is the like one going on in the background whenever

(uhh) Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster have this conversation going on because it's kind of scary for Jodie Foster but still you know, she manages to keep her calm and (uhh) poise and (uhh) you know, really good acting. (uhh)

Really (uhh) enjoy this movie now this is a widescreen special edition so it has special features like brand new inside the labyrinth documentary including all new (stutter) interviews with the cast featuring Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster and more. Twenty minutes of deleted scenes, original nineteen ninety one making of featureette, Anthony Hopkins phone message, never before seen outtake reel, 

and a whole bunch of stuff that comes along with this dvd so. (uhh) I rate this movie five on five and if you get a chance (uhh) get the dvd and watch the movie if you have not. It's The Silence of the Lambs.
