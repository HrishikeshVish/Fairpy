Hey, y'all, how's it going? My name is Jordan, and (uhh) today I'm gonna be reviewing the DVD Godzilla. 

Now, this movie

well

if you saw it, 

then you probably don't need to watch any more of this review. (umm) 

The movie kind of speaks for itself. 

(uhh) It's not really a great movie. Matthew Perry 

is actually Not Matthew Perry. What's his name? I think his name is Matthew Perry. 

(uhh) 

Matthew Perry. 

I think his name's Matthew Perry. It's the guy from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. I think his name is Matthew Perry. I'm pretty sure. 

(umm) 

Yeah. 

He's the guy 

(umm) who's the big hero in the movie, 

and (umm)

I don't think that he could really be a hero in a movie. 

(umm) He wasn't very good 

(umm) at you know trying to solve the big problems or anything like that.

(umm) The effects in this movie were not that great. This was actually 

after Jurassic Park came out and (umm) in this movie, 

the effects look worse than Jurassic Park, so people went expecting, 

you know, 

(umm) 

you know, effects that would actually look better, but no, they didn't look nearly as good as Jurassic Park. 

(umm) It actually looked kind of similar, it looks like they kind of copied some of the stuff from Jurassic Park, 

but (umm) 

as far as special features go, I mean it has a little bit of special features. Not a whole lot, 

but it has like how they created you know, some of the (umm) 

some of the character, 

you know, CGI stuff, and everything like that, and how they destroyed a lot of the buildings and stuff like that, 

but I mean, 

the movie kind of just 

isn't that great, so I mean you probably don't wanna pick this DVD up because 

(umm) the movie's not that great, so you won't be that interested in the special features, so (umm) 

I'd skip over this one 

and (uhh) look for another one. So that's it.
