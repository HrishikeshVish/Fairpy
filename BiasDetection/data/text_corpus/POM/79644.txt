I'm here to talk about this movie (uhh) Lost in Translation. It stars Bill Murray

and (uhh) it runs for an hour and forty-two minutes and it's rated R.

This has (uhh) been out for a little while and (umm)

I didn't really like this movie. It was really slow, it was boring, (uhh) the story line didn't make any sense at all. It's about some (uhh) TV personality, I guess that's what he was, that (uhh) went to Japan for to to (stutter) do some promotions and (umm) things he did there, the girl he met and all this kind of thing but

I just really didn't enjoy this and I I (stutter) just didn't understand 

what the story was about and this {sigh}. 

(umm) 

I don't I don't (stutter) know, you might like this, you might not, but I just didn't really think, you know, I don't think it was up to Bill Murray's standards but

(umm) try it, you might think differently. 

Thank you.
