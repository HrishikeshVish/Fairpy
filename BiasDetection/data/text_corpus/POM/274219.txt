Hey all, it's the king of movies here, and today I'm going to review The Clone Wars. And this is a new movie (uhh) produced by George Lucas and it's part of the Star Wars series. (uhh) It's, it's (stutter) CGI animated and (umm)

this movie's (uhh) basically a different take on the the (stutter) Star Wars (uhh) story.  It branches off in a way. And (uhh) I thought this movie was actually pretty disappointing. (umm) It's not too surprising though because the last three (uhh) the three new movies in the Star Wars episodes, episodes one through three were pretty (umm) awful overall. And this (uhh) sticks to that (uhh) same beat as (uhh) the story is, is (stutter) pretty weak. The dialogue is just horrible and it didn't seem like this is a movie that you would expect to see in theaters. It seemed more like a movie you'd, you'd find on like TV, Cartoon Network or something like that, like a (uhh) ninety minute feature length (uhh) straight to TV movie. (uhh) I wouldn't suggest watching this movie unless you're a huge Star Wars fan, and even at that I would (uhh) I would only suggest watching it on TV or DVD or something like that. It's not worth watching in theaters really. Unless you're a big fan of (uhh) the other (stutter) Star Wars related (stutter) early movies. Then (uhh) I suggest you stay away.
