I really like a lot of films that are funny when they're not supposed to be. Films that you can just sit and laugh at.

One such film: Road House,  

starring Patrick Swayze. 

It's about a bouncer (uhh) with a philosophical take on life. Actually he has a (uhh) Ph.D. in philosophy from a major university.

Yet somehow he enjoys beating the crap out of a bunch of people for a living.

{clears throat}

In this film he goes to a bar that is

pretty sketchy and needs to be cleaned up.

His first night he fires half the crew and whips the rest of the crew into shape.

(umm)

Patrick Swayze, also known as the world's most shirtless man, is, (umm)

his performance is hammy, cheesy, over the top. and all out horrible.

(uhh) The only acting performance in the film that I think is,

is (stutter) played as to what a be is Sam Elliott, otherwise known as the voice of the American Beef Council.

He's the face of grizzle, and of course he comes in with his five o'clock shadow from about, oh, three weeks ago and (umm)

rides up on a Harley, proceeds to beat the crap out of a bunch of other people.

(uhh) His performance is comical yet it was supposed to be.

(uhh) All in all if you're looking for something serious (stutter) do not watch this film. If you're wanting something you can laugh at, yeah, pick it up.
