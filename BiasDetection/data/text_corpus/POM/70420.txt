Hello, I'm Jodie and I'm here to tell you about the scary movie The Grudge. 

It wasn't really scary. It made me jump. I'm scared of anything so it was kind of scary. Has a nice death rattle in it.

{makes noise} over and over and over and over again 

and it has some creepy little Asian boy.

Any little kid's creepy to me, like The Omen, my goodness.

Anyway

(umm) It's about a house and if you enter the house then

(umm) 

you're kinda doomed I guess. When someone dies and then the grudge of a powerful rage, a curse is left behind and never forgives and never forgets.

It's supposed to be creepy. It wasn't that good of a movie. I really wouldn't suggest it.

It has Sarah Michelle Gellar. She's usually, she's (stutter) a good actress in it, I just didn't like the plot.

It is ninety-one minutes long, which is good. It's PG-thirteen, meaning it can't be that scary.

(uhh)

(umm) I think this is the 

widescreen. Yeah it's the widescreen. It has special special (stutter) features and I wouldn't really  wanna watch it. It's not really worth your time.
