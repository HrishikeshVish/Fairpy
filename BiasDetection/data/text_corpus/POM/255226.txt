Hi. My name is Mike, and this is my ExpoTV movie review of the film Over Her Dead Body, which is a movie that I guess (umm) I I (stutter) don't know, words really can't describe. It wasn't very good. It might make a good date movie. (uhh) But basically, the plot (umm) is just kind of, it seemed sort of TV movie-ish, like (uhh) like something that even Lifetime might even reject. But basically in it, you have (umm) Eva Longoria Parker, from Desperate Housewives, and she plays a bride that accidentally gets killed on her wedding day and (uhh) her fiance slash husband from that wedding day is Paul Rudd. And (uhh) he (umm) basically takes it pretty hard, as most of us would. (umm) And then (uhh) what happens from there is he decides to go consult a psychic and go sort of deal with the with the (stutter) whole situation in therapy. And, as you might expect, the psychic is an attractive female, because it is movieland, and he starts to fall in love with her. (umm) And then (uhh) from the grave, Eva Longoria Parker decides to (uhh) torture him and, and (stutter) try and break them up and everything.

And it it involves a lot of scenes where she (umm) is sort of, like, hovering over them or watching him and her as the new romance develops and stuff. So (umm) it all wraps up (uhh) toward the end as you might expect. I won't give anything away. But (umm) just overall, it's just a painful exercise to watch, not a really good movie, something that you should steer clear of (umm) even if (uhh) I'm not a fan of Desperate Housewives, but even even (stutter) (uhh) the the (stutter) person that I went with (uhh) she is, and she even hated the movie. So just overall just steer clear of this movie. (umm) If you have to entertain yourself this weekend, (uhh) buy a puzzle, maybe dogs playing poker, put it together or something, you know. But don't go see this movie.
