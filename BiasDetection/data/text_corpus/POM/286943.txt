Hi expo. Today I'd like to do a movie review for you of a movie that's currently in theaters so I have my ticket stub for here, and that's Bride Wars.

Bride Wars is a movie starring (umm) Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as Liv and Emma who are two girls who are best friends who get engaged at about the same time and (umm) they're plan to do everything together, being each other's maids of honor, et cetera et cetera. And they both want to get married at the same place until they find out that only one of them can get married at the Plaza.

(umm) And a small war between them begins (umm) because they both just (umm) don't want to make any compromises. This movie (umm) if you saw previews for it it looks kind of funny, but this movie actually wasn't very funny. It was very (umm) average, very predictable, and the acting wasn't that great. (umm) And you know I really do like to see fluffy chick flicks sometimes so I'm not against that but this one was pretty terrible. And I definitely recommend that if you're considering going to see Bride Wars that you save your money because it's not that good. So if you're looking for a movie to see with your girlfriends on a Friday night or a fluffy chick flick I would not recommend seeing Bride Wars because it's not what you expect, it's not worth the money, and it's not that good. So I don't give it a good review. Bride Wars. Don't go see it.
