This is a review for the movie Pathfinder. (uhh) What Pathfinder's about is 

it's about before America was discovered by (stutter) Christopher Columbus it was discovered by vikings. And it tells the story of 

some vikings that came to (uhh) America around the Canadian area. And for some reason they left, and they left behind one of their kids and the kid got picked up by Indians and he was raised by Indians. Then like twenty years later the vikings come back to to (stutter) take over the land and the kid has, is now a grown up and he's part of the

Indian culture and he's going to stop the vikings from taking over the Americas and ruling them and killing them all cause they're very savage people. And they're very big monstrous creatures in the movie.

It's a terrible, this is a terrible movie. I do not recommend you go see this because it's awful. It's full of cliches, it's got a stupid love story in it like everything in theaters now. And it's just ridiculous. (uhh) I wanted

the fricking bad guy to die the entire movie, I wanted the good guy to die, I wanted everybody to just die so it would be over and I wouldn't have to listen to it anymore or watch it. I was falling asleep half the way

and it was ridiculous because (uhh) ticket prices are so expensive so I don't recommend you see this. If you really, really want to see it rent it with like Netflix or something so you don't have to pay for it. It's terrible, I don't recommend it. It's called Pathfinder, so avoid this. 

It's in theaters. 

Don't go see it.
