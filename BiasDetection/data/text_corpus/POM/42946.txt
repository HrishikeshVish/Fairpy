Hi, today I'm going to be reviewing a dvd. 

Two Weeks Notice. 

(umm) Starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. 

(umm) This is the widescreen edition 

and (umm) it's PG-thirteen and it has a hundred-and-two minutes. 

(umm) And it doesn't have any extra features 

I mean, 

(umm) not many ex, not many (stutter) extra features. 

(umm) It's got the movie, visit the stars, (umm) 

the making of, it got two additional scenes, so (umm) 

but it doesn't have any bloopers or anything. (umm) 

And (umm) 

not many {sigh} extra (umm) footage that you haven't already seen if you've seen this movie. (umm) 

But other than that, mainly about the dvd because of the movie. 

(umm) It's a pretty good movie (umm) 

I'm a fan of Sandra Bullock. 

And (umm) 

this is 

(umm) 

another one of her good movies that she did (umm) 

it's about (umm) 

he's a, 

(umm) he's, (stutter) she goes to work for him. 

And (umm) they clash and 

things happen (uhh) don't want to give it away. 

But (umm) 

it's a good movie, it's kind of like a romance 

comedy movie. 

(umm) I'm not sure if guys will like it but. 

If you're a girl you'll probably like this movie. 

Check it out.
