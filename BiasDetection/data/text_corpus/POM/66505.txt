Hi, my name is Wayne and today I'm going to be reviewing this product. It's a (uhh) movie that was directed by (umm) Quentin Tarantino. It's called Pulp Fiction. (umm) Specifically this is the collector's edition. (umm) This is a really good movie. It's (uhh) loaded with famous actors and actresses. (umm) 

It's got a great story line and basically if you've ever seen any kind of (uhh) Tarantino flick, (umm) 

you know his style and how gory he is and how kind of messed up he is, but it's really just genius directing and he's my favorite (umm) director. (umm) He also makes guest appearances in all of his movies, (umm) and he does so in this one. But the story centers around (umm) kind of two boss, you know, hit men for their boss. (umm) The boss is Marsellus Wallace who's (umm) played by Ving Rhames. (umm) And the two hit men are 

(umm) Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. (umm) They're all after (umm) Bruce Willis who plays a boxer (umm) who bet on his own fight and had a deal and then broke it to make money for himself. So the whole movie has all these individual stories tying together. You know what I'm talking about if you've seen like Kill Bills or anything like that with the way Tarantino does his directing. But it's a fantastic movie, lots of good action. You'll find yourself quoting it because there's a ton of good lines in it and a lot of good dialogue. So I recommend you see Pulp Fiction.
