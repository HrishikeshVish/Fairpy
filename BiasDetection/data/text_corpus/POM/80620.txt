Hi. (umm) Today's product that I'm going to review is the DVD Bewitched starring 

Nicole 

Kidman and Will Ferrell. 

I didn't care for this movie {laugh}. (umm) I give it probably a two, a rating of two.

And the reason I didn't like it is because 

Will Ferrell plays an actor who is going to be doing a new and improved version of Bewitched and then (umm) Nicole Kidman plays a real life witch who comes down to earth to live and then ended up being cast in the role of Samantha on Bewitched.

It's just a really corny movie. (umm) I hate the way that they did that. Pretending that (umm), you know, there were two people and then

they were gonna start playing the actors Samantha and Darren so it's really not about Bewitched. (umm)

It's more about this girl who's a witch who plays Samantha.

But as I said I don't really care for it. I mean it's about two hours long. (umm)

If you're interested in watching this or even owning it {laugh} you can find it at (umm) any Best Buy, local Walmart, or even on Amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.
