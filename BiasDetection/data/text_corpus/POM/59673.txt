This is a review of the dvd movie 

Gosford Park. (umm) It came out in two thousand one on USA Films, also on Universal. (umm) {laugh} 

I'm not gonna lie I saw the previews for this movie 

in two thousand one when it came out. 

For some reason I had thought that this was going to be like (uhh) like a horror movie and people were going to be like getting killed in this house and it was going to be really sweet. 

And I always like it had been a movie in the back of my head that I'd been wanting to rent or buy for a long time. 

And I rent movies online and I put, {laugh} 

put it in my list and sure enough I get it and it is nothing like that. It's like an old stool like (umm) 

you know like a murder theme mystery in someone's house. (umm) with like British accent people, English accents. And (umm) 

I don't know, I, it definitely seemed more like a B film to me. 

I wasn't too impressed. (umm) Even like the cover like makes you think it's gonna be like some xxx nation like wrong turn, I don't know some sort of horror movie or something. And 

this really wasn't. I wasn't too impressed I hardly watched any of it and (umm) I was kind of let down, (umm) I thought the original previews in two thousand really led me astray and then I rewatched 

(umm) one on the internet (umm) today right, (uhh) 

right as I was watching it and it {laugh} seemed a lot different so I don't know maybe there's another Gosford Park out there but this Gosford Park is sure not 

(umm) a horror movie, so (uhh) 

don't rent it. 

If you're looking for a horror movie. 

At all.
