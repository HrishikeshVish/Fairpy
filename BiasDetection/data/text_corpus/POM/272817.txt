Hey everybody this is Tom and today I'm going to be reviewing The Mummy the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, or the easier way of saying it The Mummy Three. As always, movie ticket,

backwards movie ticket,

movie ticket. Alright. No it wasn't backwards movie ticket, it was the back of.

I digress, let's get into it. Brendan Frasier is back in The Mummy Three.

I don't know why. He must have had too much fun doing the other two, because this movie was not good. Not one bit.

Okay, a little bit of entertainment here and there. (uhh)

The gal who played his wife, (uhh)

from the first one, didn't come back. They aged the son to be older and just like his dad. 

Bad idea {laugh}.

(umm) Set in China but with the (uhh) this time the mummy being Jet Li, I like that. (uhh) He can control the five elements just like the other ones. Brendan Frasier's character Rick O'Connell is gonna have to save the day.

Tell me you didn't know that. Just tell me, bring it on. (umm) No, this movie wasn't good. It it (stutter) was entertaining at times. I I (stutter) did like Jonathon a lot, he was funny just like in the last two. You need the comic relief. Otherwise as a movie goes it just wasn't good. (umm)

I wish they wouldn't have come back to do a third one.

Just would have been that simple.

But hey, you know, I like the series so I thought I'm gonna go out and watch this. Probably a lot of you out there did too and I'm sorry if you did {sigh}. It's, I mean okay, it wasn't necessarily horrible, I'm not going to give this a one, but I'm going to give it a two or a three. Still borderline in my head right now, working on it. But no, it just wasn't that good. No, not one bit. The sets were good,

the idea was somewhat there {sigh}.

Just no. I I'm (stutter) going to give it a two out of five. Thanks.
