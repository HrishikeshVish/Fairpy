Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this dvd. (umm) It's The Shawshank Redemption. It stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

(umm) It's a prison story (umm) set back in the fifties.

(umm) And it was very well done, I thought. (umm) It's a story that was written by Stephen King. (umm) But it's very different than his other stories, (umm) it's not really horror. (umm) It's more of a drama.

And it's about this man Tim Robbins that gets sent to prison. (umm)

It's a very popular movie it's on tv all the time. And the dvd really does it justice, (umm) the picture quality is great on the dvd. It also has some (umm) bonus features on the dvd. (umm) It just opens up like this. And (umm)

I really enjoyed this film, you can buy this dvd for about nine dollars nowadays and I thought the acting was great, the story was great. (umm) It was just really good in every way and I would highly recommend it.
