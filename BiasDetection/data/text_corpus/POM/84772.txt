And (uhh) Little Man definitely a funny movie. It's PG thirteen and it's got the Wayans brothers in there. This one's got Marlon Wayans 

and

Shawn Wayans 

So we like them brothers, they're pretty funny guys, but anyways. 

It's about (uhh) this jewel thief that decides that he's gonna steal a jewel and he

he's a little guy. He's probably just a couple feet high and (uhh) he

steals the jewel, hides the jewel, and 

has to get this jewel back and it

winds up in a couple's home and the funny thing is this couple happens to be wanting a child so his way to get into the home was to dress up like a baby and place himself in a basket so they'll take him in and take care of him. So (uhh) it's it's (stutter) a crazy little film. A funny,

crazy, crazy funny but (uhh) I was liking it watching it. It is PG thirteen and 

{laugh} you would like it.
