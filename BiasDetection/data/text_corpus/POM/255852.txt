Hello. (uhh) For my review today I'll do Semi-Pro, the Will Ferrell new comedy out in theaters. I caught this about two days ago in the evening, I went to my local theater with my friend and both of him and myself were big fans of, like, Old School and even Ricky Bobby

and Blades of Glory were okay. But I'll have to admit for this review that Semi-Pro xxx on the same kind of comedy and jokes all the rest of them worked on, but it's almost getting a little stale. I hate to say it cause I love Will Ferrell but

the jokes are all kind of the same you've seen before. He's attacked by an animal in one scene, the downtrodden like, you know, ABA team you've got to win games to rally the crowd and the team and

I don't know. You you (stutter) want to like Will Ferrell but my reviews have to be mixed but negative. I don't want to say skip it or, you know why not get it as a rental later on? It may not be worth the full ten dollars or nine dollars they charge for a movie nowadays. As the price gets up there I have to be more and more picky about what I go to and this one I probably wouldn't go to again. There are some funny moments but they're far and few between. So

Will Ferrell Semi-Pro I might recommend you just see this at home instead of in the theater. You know what? Maybe the next one Will Ferrell.
