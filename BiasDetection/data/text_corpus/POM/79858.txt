This is White Chicks with the Wayans brothers. 

I think this movie is hilarious, like I've seen it so many times and every time I still think it's so funny.

(umm) Basically it's about these two guys who are FBI agents and the movie starts off with them trying to bust a drug deal but they catch the wrong guys and get in a lot of trouble basically. So they're trying to get back into their boss's, (umm) the chiefs, good graces.

And (umm) okay their boss says, okay you guys 

gotta just pick up these girls from the airport, these two white girls and just drive em back to the hotel. 

So, they do it, but on the way back to the hotel there's a little car accident 

and one of the girls ends up with a scratched up nose and one of them ends up with a busted lip and 

(umm) they were supposed to, the girls were supposed to go to this party the next day 

but they freak out and it's just really funny cause

they're these really rich valley girls and these little scratches are such a big deal to them

and so they refuse to go to the party.

So these guys know they have to do something, so they dress up as the girls and go to the party as them.

And (umm) there are just so many moments that are hilarious in it. So I would definitely recommend it.
