Idiocracy

{laughs}

This movie is gonna be probably one of the most retarded movies that I've seen this year. Yeah, I guess I use that term lightly, okay retarded, (uhh) but that's the whole point of Idiocracy.

But (uhh) It's (uhh) PG, I'm sorry it's actually rated R and It's about

(uhh) this guy 

and he's in the military and they chose to put him in a program where they're gonna freeze him and they're gonna unfreeze him within a year. And so, they can't find another female, to do this experiment with so they pick

(umm) basically a hooker to do it and well anyways. They freeze him and they're supposed to be waking up in a year, but the program gets stopped because of evil actions and they get forgotten and they wake up hundreds of years later and basically through

(umm) the gene pool

all the smart people have basically stopped 

of conceiving so the 

not so smart people just mass produced and

in hundreds of years people are basically just stupid and anyways.

So (uhh) stupid funny movie. That's that's (stutter) how I would describe it. But, I would have to say, you would probably enjoy it.

I I (stutter) thought it was funny, but that's the whole point of being stupid. But, you'd have to watch it to understand what I'm saying. 

So, Idiocracy, rated R. Definitely

definitely pick it up.
