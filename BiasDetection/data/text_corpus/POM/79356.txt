Alright, 

this is the (uhh) movie 

Dances with Wolves and if I were asked to put a top ten list of movies, this would definitely be in that list. Absolutely fantastic movie made by Kevin Costner, 

it won seven academy awards back in nineteen ninety-one 

and if you haven't seen this movie,

then where have you been 

because this movie is fantastic. All about captain John Dunbar and his growing up in the frontier and encountering

(uhh) the native American xxx tribe and it's just a fantastic so (uhh) really beautifully filmed. (uhh) The music is fantastic, the acting is great (uhh), one thing I should mentioned is 

almost four hours long, it's three hours 

and what fifty-six minutes long. 

(uhh) It's probably up (stutter) in nineteen ninety-one when this came out. Never had a show ever been released this long and I don't think there has been a show since then. Lord of the Rings wasn't maybe more than maybe three and a half hours. 

Very long movie but, 

(stutter) the time flies by, absolutely fantastic. Now it is rated PG thirteen. 

(uhh) There's some tense scenes in it, some hunting scenes. (uhh) 

The sexual amount in it is some xxx (uhh) but nothing overt (umm) that I can recall. (umm) So, the PG thirteen rating I think is primary there's some a little bit profanity in it and there's like I said some tense scenes.

But absolutely fantastic show, you gotta watch this if you haven't seen it. Rent it, buy it, (uhh) if you have seen it, it's back up here since it's been out so you might want to get it again and pull it out and watch it again.
