Welcome back. This is Killfast37, and I'm reporting in once again.

Now, today's review is going to be about a terrible movie called House of the Dead. It's it's (stutter) a movie adaptation from the video game House of the Dead. It was very popular back in the arcades a few years ago. Now, Uwe Boll decided to make a movie about it. And the movie didn't turn out so great.

(umm) There are zombies that run and know Kung Fu. All the teenagers in the movie know how to use guns and all kinds of crazy stuff. And they all also know martial arts. There are random explosions, random gore, random violence, and random sex. It's extremely {sigh} it's hard to turn away. It's like a train wreck happening in slow motion. You want to look away, but you can't. That's how bad this movie is.

I mean, if you're a fan of zombies, don't even check it out. It's just going to make you upset, like it has me. I love zombies. House of the Dead is not a good movie. Stay far away from it and burn it in coals when you do see it.

It's an abomination to the film industry, and it's just, it's just (stutter) awful. Please avoid this movie at all costs.

House of the Dead, I give you one star. If I could give you less, I would. This is almost as bad as Manos Hands of Fake.

Well, that's all I've got to say about this movie because it's so terrible. I'll see you next time, hopefully, on a better review.
