Hi, my name's Jennifer and I'm here to talk about the movie 

Meet the Parents. 

Now Meet the Parents stars Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro. 

It's all about how Ben Stiller wants his girlfriend Pam's parents, who's Robert De Niro, 

so that he can ask his girlfriend her hand in marriage but he's gonna get permission from her family first. 

And this is just an incredibly funny movie where everything goes wrong. 

So if you've ever had a boyfriend or a girlfriend and you've tried to meet their family 

and just, the worst thing that could possibly happen has happened over and over again, that's what this movie's about. 

First he loses his luggage, his suitcase (umm) 

he's not in tune with the family secret so he ends up 

just doing some very dumb stuff that he ends up getting caught for later. 

You'll find out what it is, 

that the ex-boyfriend he meets he doesn't make a very good impression, he doesn't make a good impression the rest of the family and just very funny. 

(umm) How he comes out of it. 

And how they come out of it together. 

And you'll have to watch it to see if Ben Stiller ever does get to ask his girlfriend Pam to marry him, and if he ever gets his, her, 

(umm) father's approval. 

It's just a very good movie if you've liked movies like Dodgeball, or nearly the new Night In the Museum, you will xxx Meet the Parents. 

And afterwards you'll have to see Meet the Fockers which is the sequel, which is just as good as the first one. 

And this is from Dreamworks Pictures Universal Studios, 

Meet the Parents starring Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro.
