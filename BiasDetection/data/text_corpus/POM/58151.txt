I'm reviewing the movie Inner Space. 

This is VHS cassette but they also have (umm) a DVD. But this movie is a is a (stutter) good movie. There's (uhh) 

a little bit of language but it's it's (stutter)rated PG. 

(umm) it's nothing (stutter), the language is not bad at all. I mean

depends on how you are with language. But (uhh) it's in color, it's a hundred and twenty minutes. (umm) It's got (uhh)

Meg Ryan

and Dennis Quaid in this movie and (uhh) I recommend this movie. It's funny, it's action packed, 

and (uhh) it's a good storyline. But you can get this from Amazon dot com

for probably under five dollars since it's VHS or, you know, you could also get the DVD probably under ten. But I recommend this movie, it's (uhh) it's a cute movie. Even kids would like this. 

So again it's Inner Space and it's a Steven Spielberg film.
