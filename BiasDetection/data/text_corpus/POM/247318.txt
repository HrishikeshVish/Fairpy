Hello Expo TV. Today I have for you a review of a movie currently in theaters the Bee Movie.

(uhh) In my opinion the Bee Movie is exactly that, a B movie. B here standing for bad.

(umm) In some ways I look at this movie as (umm) an attempt, I don't know by either

(stutter) the actors in the movie or the company who produced it to get back on it's feet or something it didn't really.

It was supposed to be a comedy, an animation and perhaps a kids movie and it was that. It was a kids movie. It wasn't very funny. It wasn't very entertaining.

(umm) It really didn't

(uhh) add anything and give anything know to you know (umm) cinematography (stutter) 

(umm) It's basically just what the title says, a bad movie, a B movie (umm) and I really do think that. I give it two out of five stars. (umm) Perhaps you know, (stutters) two out of five instead of one out of five because I did laugh sometimes. (umm) It just didn't do it for me though. It was

it was all in all a bad movie. I would not recommend it. Two out of five stars, the Bee Movie.
