Good morning expotv. Today I'm reviewing the Da Vinci code in DVD format, special edition two discs. This is a famous book that was made into a movie authored by Dan Brown. This is a thrilling book and this movie really shows the book. It's not one of those books is a lot better movie,

but this really shows the book and

how much went into this movie is incredible, how detailed it is, the video quality is (stutter) it's amazing. Well obviously it is, it was made (stutter) like a year ago. This is rated PG-thirteen for some of the (uhh)

disturbing images and violence. You see someone die, you see someone stabbed with marks all across his chest which is a little violent. 

This has Tom Hanks in it who is a great actor. (I stutter) They definitely picked the (stutter) right person to play this. And this is a movie about, 

really about religion and how it goes back and it's really interesting. I know it's not real but it's an interesting movie if you're just looking for a good movie to watch with some friends.
