Hey shoppers my name is Jeff and this is Gladiator. 

It stars Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. 

(uhh) It's set in the time of the Roman empire and when (uhh) Maximus is (uhh) 

the head of all of the armies of Rome. 

And unfortunately (umm) 

when they're (uhh) Roman emperor dies, and (uhh) Joaquin Phoenix takes over he wants (uhh) Russel Crowe to swear his allegiance. 

(uhh) Russell Crowe doesn't do that because he believes that the young Joaquin Phoenix has killed (uhh) his father in order to take the (uhh) the throne. (uhh) When that happens (uhh) Joaquin Phoenix's character pretty much (umm)

as a trade and they fight. 

And it's a story of (uhh) this man 

fighting his way through all the gladiator battles in order to get close enough 

(umm) to Joaquin Phoenix in order to (umm) kill him
