Hi (umm) today the product that I'm going to review is 

a DVD. 

It's called I Love You... Don't Touch Me! (umm) 

This is 

a story about 

a 

young woman 

(umm) 

is probably based in the 1990s or something. 

But it's a story of a young woman 

(uhh) who's twenty-five who 

is (umm) 

basically in love with love and she's trying to find mister right. 

But (umm) 

it's kind of a 

boring movie. 

(umm) 

I just watched it to find out if she happens to get together 

with her (umm) best friend, 

who is who is (stutter) a guy (umm) who's in love with her. 

But she has 

(umm) no feelings for him, no feelings of love for him in the beginning. 

And she (umm) 

the story focuses a lot on 

(umm) 

intimacies. {laughter} Between 

men and women. (umm) A little bit too much. 

She uses, 

is a lot of foul language in this movie. 

(umm) Even though it's 

(umm) 

PG-thirteen. I 

don't like it. 

(umm) If you'd like to 

watch this movie or 

you wanna own the movie you can find it on amazon dot com or on (stutter) DVD discounts for under twenty dollars.
