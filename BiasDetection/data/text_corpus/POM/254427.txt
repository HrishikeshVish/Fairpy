What's up guys I am going to review a movie that I think and actually many people agree with me (uhh) critics and fans alike that is one of or maybe the best war movie (umm) ever made and it's called Saving Private Ryan it stars Tom Hank's of course (umm)

Matt Damon and a cast of others including Vin Diesel if you're a fan of his and it's about (umm)

you know a setting in World War Two and a mother who has lost three of her four sons in the war, so there is one squadron's mission to go and find the fourth son whose name is Private Ryan (umm) the movie goes through that it goes through the realities of war and World War Two what happened there and what happened to them (umm) It's seen through the eyes of these soldiers you know they question their orders they don't understand why they have to risk their life (umm)

Ryan questions his orders he just wants to stay and fight for his country (umm)

and really just goes through their struggles of your your (stutter) everyday you know American soldier in World War Two, and it's poignant and it's beautiful, and you know it won five academy awards including best director Steven Spielberg of course you know it's hailed by everybody Time Magazine, USA Today, New York Times, Entertainment Weekly, (umm) it won best picture award at the the (stutter) Toronto broadcast film critic special. It just it's really a beautiful movie (uhh) most people have seen it and agree it's the best one ever made if you haven't, if you're a war movie buff (umm) if you love history, all of the above for me, or if you just want to watch a good movie pick up Saving Private Ryan because you will not regret it.
