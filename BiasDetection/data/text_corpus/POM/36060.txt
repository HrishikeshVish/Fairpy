I'm reviewing GI Jane. This movie is rated R. (umm) For adult content. (umm) {cough}

This is a really good movie it stars Demi Moore. And this movie is about Demi Moore who tries to join the Navy SEALs (umm) and goes to boot camp. It's about her going through boot camp and all the things that she has to go through. (umm)

While they're all the guys that are there kinda (umm) make it harder for her to try to get out of boot camp. (umm) And so she's having to work doubly hard more than the other people, the other guys that are around her. (umm) So it just goes about all the stuff that she's has to go through to become a Navy SEAL. (umm) It's very good movie it is kind of action oriented, drama type of movie. (umm)

But I definitely recommend viewing this movie. (umm) And

it is rated R although some of it's might be suitable for older teenagers, (umm) I would recommend viewing it before letting them watch it. And but I do recommend (umm) GI Jane.
