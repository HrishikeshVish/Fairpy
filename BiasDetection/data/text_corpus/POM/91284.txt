Comic book geeks rejoiced everywhere when they announced the making of X-men

(uhh) into a movie.

X-men is a (uhh)

story of a bunch of (uhh) mutant superheroes whose powers they use to stop evil. (uhh) They're all gathered around (uhh) Professor Xavier who runs a school for the gifted which basically means a bunch of mutants go there and they learn to use their powers. (uhh) The movie (uhh) is a very poor adaption of a comic book. They have some of the characters of course not my favorites, Gambit Jubilee and just to name a few that they're missing. (uhh) {cough} they do have Wolverine which seems to be the most popular, (uhh) I guess they thought that would bring in the majority of the fans and have a lot of (uhh) video game spinoffs.

Unfortunately the movie is just lacking

a lot of big names, Halle Berry (uhh)

(uhh) Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine, it's really kind of lacking. (uhh) The Storyline is mediocre at best. The acting

I don't even wanna think about the acting. (uhh)

Magneto, the character (uhh) that controls metal is

pretty much the only well done thing in the movie. (uhh) Comic book fans and movie fans alike, avoid this one.
