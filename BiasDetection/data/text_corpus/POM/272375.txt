I went to the movies to see Pineapple Express. It wasn't my choice of movie to see, but I was outvoted on that one.

It was okay. (umm)

I I'm (stutter) really not into movies about stoners and drugs and stuff like that. And that's what the Pineapple Express movie is. (umm) It stars Seth Rogen, who has been in just about every (uhh) movie lately, it seems like. He was in the movie Stepbrothers. (umm) He was in the movie, the voice of a, one of the characters in Kung Fu Panda. He was in Knocked Up and Superbad. And he's really making a name for himself lately. I just didn't really think this was the best movie to go see. (umm) Pineapple Express (uhh) the movie got its name because that's supposedly the name of a new new (stutter) strain of marijuana.

And (uhh) (uhh) and they talk about that during the movie. It's definitely not for kids. It's just for adults. (umm) If you're not into what I would call a drug movie, you probably wouldn't like it. It was okay. It passed the time. It's not one that I would recommend to people to go see. They would probably find another movie that they would like better. You know, if if (stutter) you've seen everything else out in the theaters and you're wanting to go to the movies, you're looking for something to see, it will entertain you, it will pass the time, but it wouldn't be my first pick of a movie to (uhh) tell somebody to go see.
