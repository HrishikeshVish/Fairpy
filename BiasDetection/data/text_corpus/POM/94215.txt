Hi I'm Tom and I'm reviewing broken lizards Club Dread. This movie is very bad I'm giving it two out of five stars. 

I loved broken lizards' first two films, 

Puddle Cruiser and 

Supertroopers. They were both really, really funny. 

Supertroopers is one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to know they're now making a sequel. 

However this movie is not 

anywhere on that level, it's, it's (stutter) bad in my opinion. 

It follows the broken lizard gang as they own a resort in the Caribbean. 

(uhh) And it's just not very funny. 

(umm) (stutter) There instead of being a cop parody, this is a horror parody 

and I feel there have been enough horror parodies done the past few years and this one is not very, very good. 

(uhh) There are some humorous taunt moments in it. 

But overall the story is just, 

you know it's just campy and it's too 

cliche horror parody. (umm) 

Supertroopers was still, very was still pretty realistic like yeah it's, it's (stutter) still comedy and it's far fetched. 

But this people I mean, I mean (stutter) I don't know I guess you know horror is so far fetched with people come back to life but this one is just not very good. 

So, two out of five stars.
