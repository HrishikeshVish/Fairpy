I'm doing a review on the movie Beer League.  

This movie is rated R.  

(uhh), This is the two disc (uhh) collectors edition (uhh) xxx, of one hundred and forty-five minutes of unrated bonus features.  

(uhh), this is overall a pretty good movie. It stars Artie Lange as well as (uhh) Ralph Macchio.

(uhh) I liked it, I mean, it wasn't what I expected, but I mean it was a pretty good movie, 

it was a comedy.  

(uhh) The movie is about a bunch of guys that (uhh), hang out at this bar,

(uhh) and they play on the same ball team.  

(uhh) The softball team they play on is (uhh),

the beer league. 

(uhh) It's In the beer league. They play (uhh),

 play teams from different bars and stuff.  

(uhh) They are a bunch of misfits (uhh),

and I mean they do everything from fight to a bunch of stuff at the, at the (stutter) games.  

But (uhh), this one team (uhh),

you know, ends up,

you know realizing, hey, what are we doing, you know, 

and they have a, 

a mission to win.  

(uhh) because, you know, one of the guys ends up running, falling in love with this girl or you know, 

and he wants to impress her so he,

he (stutter) has a change of heart and you know, wants to win.  

If you want to find out if they win and what happens I recommend you picking this movie up.  

Again this movie is Beer League.
