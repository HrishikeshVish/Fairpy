Hi guys, I'm here to to talk to you about the movie Garam Masala. It's a Bollywood Hindi movie, so it contains Akshay Kumar and John Abraham, two great Bollywood actors that are rising, especially Akshay Kumar who has been around in Bollywood.

It's a really great funny movie. It has a great story line. It's overall one of the best like one of the great Bollywood movie. I wouldn't say the best but it's up there where people can have a good family enjoyment. It's not, it's not (stutter) even too like, based of of age or teenagers or anything so a lot of people will watch it. (uhh) My parents watched it too and they enjoyed it. Any age could, young and old, there's nothing explicit or anything there. (uhh) There's also another great actor at the top here. He's really funny, he makes a lot of jokes throughout the whole movie and then, the overall theme and the story line of it is just great. So this movie's made by Venus records or Venus group. (umm) Another thing about this movie, it has a cool case, as you can tell. You can take it off, it's a cover. Then you open up another and you have, other guide. It's just like, it gives like a cool brief thing. It has a cool pull out just to see the actresses in the movie and here's another one and then it just finally gets the DVD.

Where it's a two-pack combo. One is just with features and things at the end.

(umm) Another great part about this movie is that it just, it's Bollywood is a rising industry and then this is one of the great films that came out of it. Thank you.
