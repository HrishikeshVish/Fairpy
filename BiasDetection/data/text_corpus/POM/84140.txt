Hey ExpoTV, I'm Dea, and I generally love sort of these bad teen comedy sort of movies. 

(uhh) But like I said, generally which implies that I don't always love them.

One that I didn't love was Drive Me Crazy 

(umm) this is a movie with Melissa Joan Hart, where 

her character, she's trying to (uhh) 

she's trying to like, get the 

popular basketball guy or whatever to ask her out. 

And so 

and her best friend next door neighbor guy, 

is trying to win back his exgirlfriend. 

So they turn to each other. 

You know, to sort of fake a relationship to make those two jealous, 

Melissa Joan Hart gives him a makeover, 

and it's all, it all (stutter) feels very like, 

it's not, 

it's not, (stutter) it doesn't have the sort of undercurrent of satire that a lot of high school comedies have, 

that sort of make them funny. It seems like it's missing something, and it's just overall not really great, and I wouldn't really suggest it to yeah.
