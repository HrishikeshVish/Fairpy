Hi. Today I am (uhh) going to to talk to you about

(umm)

an excellent movie that I saw (umm) which is Three-Hundred. 

(umm) 

Three-Hundred was an awesome movie. It was full of adventure, excitement, (umm) fighting, (umm)

blood, gore, (umm) all that good stuff all in one movie. (umm) It's really cool. (umm) One of my favorite parts about the movie was, it was an excellent movie, first off. It's probably one of my favorite movies now. (umm) 

But was like the (umm)

like how they filmed it. Like it was just

so so (stutter) neat and like, so different but pretty. (uhh) All about it, (umm) the whole movie is just filled with that. It's

so excellent. It's like in between (umm) 

being like real and being like a painting 

but it's still real. (umm) If that makes any sense. (umm) It's very (uhh) artistic. It's awesome, excellent. It's about (umm) (uhh)

King (uhh) 

Leonidas (umm) and his (uhh)

army of three-hundred Spartans. They go and they fight (umm) pretty much the Persian army that is going to attack and try to (umm) take over Spartan and all that stuff. (umm) So basically it's about, you know, them fighting and they, 

they do pretty well (umm) 

til the very end, and not going to ruin that for you, but (umm) go check it out at a theater near you. It's awesome, and it's definitely worth the ticket price. (uhh) I believe it's rated R so it may not be the best for kids but for adults definitely should go check it out. It's one of my favorite movies so go see Three-Hundred today. Thanks.
