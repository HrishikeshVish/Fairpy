Hi, I'm going to review for you today the movie Pan's Labyrinth, which is still in theaters.

(umm) This, I had no idea when I went to go see this movie, I I (stutter) didn't know anything about it really.

(uhh) I was just going with some friends and 

(uhh) you know, went in and 

(uhh) I guess, it it (stutter) has elements of fantasy and is kind of like an Alice in Wonderland story.

(uhh) And by the end of the movie I I (stutter) love this movie. It's it's (stutter) great. It was really good.

(uhh) It's, it's (stutter) got like

(uhh) It's pretty dark I guess. It's kind of scary in some points. It's not really a kids movie. 

(umm) But the main, you know, plot is that this girl

(uhh) just

(uhh) uses uses (stutter) her imagination to escape where she is. 

(uhh) And you know, and and (stutter) like meets all these magical creatures that are really cool. Like, I hadn't, I really haven't seen most of these creatures like in other movies and stories.

(uhh) At least the way they're portrayed here, you know. The the (stutter) creatures themselves have been in myth, in (stutter) mythical stories a lot but like, I really like the way that they're they're shown in this movie.

The story itself is really good. The ending's pretty sad. I really liked it though.

(umm) If you're looking for a pretty interesting movie, I'd definitely recommend (stutter) Pan's Labyrinth.
