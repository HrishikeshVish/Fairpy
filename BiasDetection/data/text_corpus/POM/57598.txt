Hi. I'm here reviewing Borat, the movie 

(uhh) based on the Borat actor from the Ali G. show.

I found this movie to be just so ridiculously hilarious

that I think any fan of

the Ali G. show just has to buy this DVD. Anyone who's not a fan of

the Ali G. show, I think they'll still love this movie. It was, like, it's so ridiculous, all, (stutter) almost all of it was unscripted.

(uhh) And it was just Sasha Baron Cohen in character going around basically messing with people. He got sued by a bunch of people,

just to show how real this movie was.

(umm) There are just some things that, like, you do not expect half of this movie. Like, it just comes out of nowhere and is just hilarious.

They do some ridiculous things. The actual

DVD cover, it has, like, and English slip-on. When you take that off, everything is in Russian.

And (uhh) it looks like it's a bootleg DVD. If you look over here, it looks like the actual cover is just a bent-up piece of paper. The actual DVD looks like it's a burnt disc. And it says "Demorez". "Is life? No. Is Demerez." (uhh) It's (uhh) making fun of Memorex because their slogan is "Is it live or is it Memorex?" So I thought that was just really well done. It says "Borat" in Cyrillic letters over here.

And there's a bunch of extra features, such as (umm) deleted scenes, (uhh) a bunch of other things. And all of that was hilarious. The actual DVD menu is written in broken English and just done like as if it was bootlegged. (uhh) Yeah, so I'm definitely giving this a five out of five. Everyone should buy this.
