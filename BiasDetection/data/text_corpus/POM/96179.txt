The product I'm unfortunately reviewing today is Garfield the movie. 

Now I didn't buy this movie, 

I don't think anybody bought this movie. The stars of the movie, their parents wouldn't buy this movie. 

(umm) I won this (umm) at the second door prize something. (umm) 

The the (stutter) best thing I can say about this movie is that it comes in a fancy orange DVD case. 

(umm) They probably should have actually called the movie (uhh) Bill Murray needs a paycheck. (uhh) 

He does the voice of Garfield. (uhh) I don't know why (uhh) someone like Billy Murray would 

(uhh) slum it doing this. (umm) The other stars in the movie are Brecken Meyers and Jennifer Love Hewitt, but they're washed up it's not surprising they're in a movie like Garfield. (umm) 

The movie pretty much (uhh) (stutter) follows the plot of the (uhh) the daily comic. Garfield hates Mondays. Garfield loves lasagna. Garfield kicks Odie. (uhh) 

This movie is not funny, it's not good. CGI was stupid. (umm) I, I (stutter) really don't know if just, never see this movie please. (uhh) 

I can't really say much more because I think I'm going to go insane in front of this box any more. One in five.
