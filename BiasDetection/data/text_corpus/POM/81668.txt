I'm here to review this dvd. 

And it's called Sixteen Candles. 

It stars Molly Ringwald, 

and (uhh) it's been out for, for quite awhile, so (uhh), 

you know you may have to look a little harder to find it

if you want to see this. 

(uhh) I was very disappointed in this because

it's rated PG. 

Now that has to be a typo, 

because there's (uhh) a lot of bad language, and there's nudity 

in this movie. And (uhh) 

I would be really, really careful in watching your kids, (uhh) letting your kids see this because 

it's not appropriate. 

And it's, that's my recommendation this this (stutter) is not appropriate for for (stutter) young kids to see.

It (uhh) I believe it's even been on tv but I'm sure they had to delete those scenes but if you watch this movie, 

those things are in there and (uhh) 

for little kids, this movie is deceptive because it looks like it's, you know, it's for (uhh) teenagers or whatever, 

but (umm)

I I (stutter) just was greatly disappointed in this, 

but (uhh) I don't, 

I don't (stutter) (uhh) suggest you watch this at all. I mean if you want to check it out if you're curious after what I said, that's that's (stutter) up to you but

(uhh) I don't understand why it says PG on the back when all that stuff is in there, so. 

(umm)

Try it if you want, and (uhh) 

you know, use your own judgement.
