I am reviewing shop girl. Has Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Jason (stutter) Schwartzman and (umm) the movie is rated R. And it is described as a cute romantic comedy on the back.

I would not recommend this movie at all {laughter}. It is based on a short novel or novella written by Steve Martin. And so I had these expectations that this movie would be along the lines of (umm) Roxanne or (umm)

You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, Never Been Kissed, that kind of cute romantic comedy. It is, to me very dark. (umm) It's actually a little odd. It's this girl (umm) basically is kinda torn between these two guys. A young guy that's not going anywhere and a rich older entrepreneur who's Steve Martin. But he has issues and the young guy has issues and there's a lot of sex in it and it's, it's just not a movie at all that I would recommend. So if you see this at the rental place, do not rent it.
