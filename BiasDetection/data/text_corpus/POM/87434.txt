So remember my review of Ocean's Twelve and how terrible it was? Well now I'm going to review Ocean's Eleven, which was actually very very good.

This movie stars (uhh) (uhh) George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, George Pitt, Julia Roberts and a bunch of other guys too. (umm) it is very good. It's about these guys who have to break into a casino to rob it in Las Vegas. And so (umm) even for someone like me who's never actually been to Las Vegas this is very, very interesting. Because it kind of, I mean even though it's probably not all true, gives a fun look into what they've envisioned the back rooms and secret passageways of the casinos to be like. So it's very fun. It allows you to really get into it as the viewer, (umm) which not all movies are like nowadays. A lot of them have a sort of disconnect. (umm) But it seems like a very (umm) easy movie to understand. And it's just a lot of fun. You find yourself really (umm) rooting for the main characters and hoping they'll get it, even though they are criminals you find yourself very much along with the ride, along with them for the ride. 

(umm) Now the DVD itself is full of (uhh) just a ton of behind the scenes documentaries, (umm) extended scenes, extra deleted scenes, (uhh) interviews with directors, casts, everything. It's just really packed full of stuff. So if you're looking for a good DVD to spend a Saturday afternoon with, Ocean's Eleven, check it out.
