Hello, my name is Jocelyn. I'd like to tell about a movie that I went to see recently because I love this director. M. Night Shyamalan's Happening, or The Happening. I was so pumped because he gave a little bit of a review online, maybe a little trailer teaser, and it pulled me in because as in his own words he said he tried to make a movie about

something very scary and he wanted to be like The Godfather, The Exorcist, and The Birds. You know, the Alfred Hitchcock The Birds, it's so classically scary.

I'm afraid he failed. It was pretty interesting and it does give pause and it makes you think especially about the bees disappearing, and by the way that is really true, it's kind of frightening.

It didn't really have a really good plot. (uhh) Mark Mark (stutter) Wahlberg was the main character. There were many other characters that I've seen in other movies but I'm not really familiar with them. (umm)

It was almost predictable. You could tell the minute they started talking about the bees in the movie what is going to happen in the end. And (uhh) it does deal with Mother Nature and there is a little bit of a surprise at the very end. You have to go see it to (uhh) get that surprise because (umm)

it was kind of (uhh) good. It (stutter) actually it made me feel a little bit better when I saw the very ending because the movie, like I said, it was kind of predictable and I've seen a lot of these movies and it was kind of all clumped together with all these theories and sort of things like that so it was a bit of a disappointment because I really went and I was prepared to be afraid, and I'm afraid that didn't happen.
