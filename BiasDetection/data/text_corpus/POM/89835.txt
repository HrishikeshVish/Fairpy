Chris Tucker is known for his off the wall slapstick comedic performances. At the same time, Jackie Chan is known for his martial arts special effects action flicks. Combine the two and you get Rush Hour two, the sequel to the very popular Rush Hour one. 

(uhh) In this the, (uhh)

Chris Tucker plays a policeman that goes to Hong Kong with his, (uhh) to meet up with his friend that he met in the first movie that's played by Jackie Chan, and together they uncover a crime ring,

beat the crap out of a whole bunch of people, and generally just do really dumb things. (umm)

{clears throat}

The acting in this one is not really acting so much as one person fights and beats the crap out of others, (umm)

the other star of the movie makes loud-mouth, (uhh) off-color remarks through the entire thing.

(umm)

It's supposed to be 

hilariously funny,

it's unfortunately not. It's quite the opposite.

(uhh) There are a few (uhh) good moments in there,

(umm) however I really didn't, (uhh) really didn't enjoy the film all that much.

(umm) 

If you're (uhh) a fan of action you're, you're (stutter) gonna be a little bit disappointed because it's overshadowed by Chris Tucker's obnoxious performance, so I wouldn't recommend this film.
