This is the platinum edition of Aladdin, 

(umm) one of Walt Disney's movies that came out in nineteen ninety two. 

This version came out a few years ago though.

(umm) Aladdin is a story about this guy, Aladdin, who lives in Agrabah and

(umm) he is very poor. He pretty much has to steal to live. He always dreams about living in the palace and one day he's in the marketplace and he meets Princess Jasmine, who has run away, and 

(umm) he doesn't know she's the princess but eventually he finds out and

(umm) he also comes across a magic lamp which helps him become a prince

(umm) and therefore he can see Jasmine more and it's just really sweet story about him and Jasmine.

(umm) This version has a lot of backstage (umm) features.

(umm) It actually shows you that before (umm) the final copy, they were gonna have Aladdin having a mom but, and they were gonna have a whole song with Aladdin and his mom called "Proud of Your Boy", but in the end, they completely took the mom out of the story. So it has cool stuff like that. So Aladdin is a great movie.
