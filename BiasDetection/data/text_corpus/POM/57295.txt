Hi. (umm) Today the product that I'm going to review is a VHS (umm) called Mrs. Winterbourne. This stars Shirley MacLaine, Ricki Lake, and then Brendan Fraser. This story (umm) is about a young girl, Connie, and (uhh) played by Ricki Lake, of course. She is from the (umm) poor side of the {laugh} street. She's poor. And (uhh) she runs away from her family, or her father and goes out to New York, falls for a not-so-nice guy and (uhh) winds up getting pregnant and (uhh) the guy kicks her out. And so she leaves him and (uhh) it follows her life as she is mistaken for another young lady who was married to Brendan Fraser's twin brother. 

And (uhh) it follows her as she goes through trying to pretend that she is this other girl. And it it's (stutter) a great movie. You can also find this in DVD or VHS on Amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.
