Hi guys, so I am here today to tell you about one of my favorite holiday movies. (umm) One of ours in our household we watch every single year Christmas eve (umm) and sometimes twice so it is the Chevy Chase National Lampoon Christmas Vacation. (umm) It goes along with his other movies with the other Chevy Chase movies (umm) with his character is Clark Griswald so I'm sure you guys have heard of it or seen it. We quote this movie all the time (umm) and and (stutter) often seeing the songs played in there for three or four days so we sing it and then the next day someone else will be singing it the next day my son will be singing it and then the next day my husband, and so on and so on and so on. So if we catch you singing this song, well we say that I am on a dork song. So (umm) this is one of our favorite movies again it's the Chevy Chase (umm) Christmas Vacation one {laughter} it's it's (stutter) his family and he puts up I think he puts about twenty-five thousand lights on his house (umm) and you can see the meter spinning and spinning and spinning in the (umm) electrical meter at the (umm) I guess the electrical company (umm) So the swat team is called in all kinds of crazy things happen (umm) there's a squirrel in the Christmas tree (umm) there's uncle Eddie which is one of by far one of my favorite characters in the movie so if you haven't seen this movie and you love Christmas movies, this is definitely a comedy Christmas movie that you would want to go see. It is a little bit older, you can tell it's a little bit dated with the fashion that is in it but, if you haven't seen it, I would definitely say go check it out. Go they have it on red box, they have it (uhh) at any stores, anywhere you can think of. So I would say go check it out. Thanks, happy holidays.
