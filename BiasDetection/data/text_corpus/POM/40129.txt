Forty Days and Forty Nights. This is a pretty silly film with Josh Hartnett. 

Basically I think he gives up (umm)

he becomes abstinent for forty days and forty nights for Lent

and (umm) everyone around him, including his friends and all of (uhh) his coworkers, he's a real ladies man, they have a bet that

(umm) you know, how long it will take him to fall off the wagon, if you will.

And so he had (umm) a relationship with his ex-girlfriend that was kind of

shaky and (umm) he meets a new girl while he's taking this vow of celibacy and, and (stutter) it basically (umm) tells the story of their relationship while he's trying to finish this vow of celibacy. And all of his friends, you know, are urging him 

to (umm) break it, basically because they have a lot of money riding on it. And it it (stutter) tells the story of (umm) that dynamic as he (uhh) keeps that vow or, I won't give it away but (uhh) it's a pretty silly film. It's It's (stutter) probably worth viewing if you're bored. I would give it a six out of ten.
