I'm reviewing Vertical Limit. This movie stars Chris O'Donnell, Bill Paxton, Robin Tunney and Scott Glenn. (umm) This movie is PG-thirteen. (umm) It's in pretty much an action packed drama movie. (umm) It's about

(umm) some people that are climbing or attempting to climb K two, which is a mountain in Pakistan. (umm)

It's a brother and sister (umm) the sister takes up a team up to the mountain (umm) to try to climb to the top something happens to that trip. (umm) And

they are kind of lost and they fell in a cave. (umm) So her brother hears about it (umm) and he comes up and tries to rescue her. (umm) So it's very action packed, and it's a very good movie. (umm) It is rated PG-thirteen but like I said that's more I think (umm) for I guess kind of the violent scenes, (umm) people do fall of cliffs and stuff like that so, you might just wanna watch it before letting the children view it.
