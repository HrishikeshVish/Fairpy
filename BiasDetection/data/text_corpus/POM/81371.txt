Adam Sandler has a lot of movies out. (uhh) He started on Saturday Night Live and then broke into the (uhh)

movie industry. Airheads is one of his earlier movies. (umm) Also it's got Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi.  The three play a (umm)

metal band, a trio that wants desperately to get heard on the radio and more than anything to have a record deal. (umm)

They are all pretty insane and (uhh) they break into a record station with squirt guns filled with hot sauce. {clearing throat} Of course the squirt guns it explains early in the movie (uhh) do not have the orange cap to indicate that they are toys as opposed to real weaponry. (umm) 

The whole movie centers around the three trying to get a record deal and getting closer to each other, yeah yeah, all that good stuff. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to be a feel good movie of the year. Hilariously funny, pretty offensive and vulgar at times, but it's definitely worth seeing. (umm) Performances in it are amazing. Adam Sandler plays an idiot which I'm not sure at the time he made the movie was too far a stretch of the imagination. However, it's still a good acting job. I would say definitely check this movie out if you're a metal head.
