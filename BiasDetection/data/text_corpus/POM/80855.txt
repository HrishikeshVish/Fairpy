Alright. 

Pretty, pretty good. Season four Curb Your Enthusiasm. The acclaimed series. Larry David returns for a fourth season. He had five in total, so far. Hopefully he comes back for six. That's my fingers being crossed. (uhh) Ten episodes this whole, actually eleven because the tenth episode is pretty much two episodes of it together and it's like an hour. (uhh) This whole season is about him

{clears throat}

joining the (uhh) cast of (uhh) The Producers,

he's in a couple episodes. Ben Stiller, and Ben Stiller's boy are in some episodes. David Schwimmer and some guy playing David Schwimmer's dad is in this too. (umm)

curmudgeon and a genius. There you go.
