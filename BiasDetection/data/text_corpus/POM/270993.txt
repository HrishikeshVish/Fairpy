Hello I want to talk to you about Iron Man. This is a great movie based on the Marvel Comics hero Iron Man. And the main character is played by Robert Downey Junior. Now if you know anything about the comic you know that Tony Stark is an eccentric billionaire, he's a weapons designer. He's had a history of (uhh) kind of a substance abuse problems. He's a little bit a smart alec and got a great sense of humor. And really I can't think of anyone else who could have played him better than Robert Downey Junior. Now that I've described Tony Stark then you may have seen several similarities with Robert Downey Junior, such as the history of the (uhh) substance abuse, plus he's a very charming guy and it worked really well (uhh) in this movie. (uhh) The basic plot is that (uhh) Tony Stark is (uhh) developing a new weapon, goes to the Middle East to kind of show it off, and he gets kidnapped by terrorists. (uhh) Things happen (uhh) while he's captured, he escapes through his own ingenuity, and he kind of has to rethink his life and decide where he wants to go from there. And he does the logical step and becomes a superhero. But I think that this is a great movie, it's a lot deeper than a lot of the other superhero movies that are out there, but there's a lot of humor in it as well. This is got a lot of little things in there that if you're a comic book fan you're really gonna notice, look for Captain America's shield in the background in one of the scenes. I looked for a cameo of Stan Lee, but just a lot of fun things in there. You really need to see this movie of course (uhh) it's got a great supporting cast as well, there's Jim Rodingrolls and Pepper Potts and all the comic book characters are in the movie. And they're all played very well, so I really think you need to see this movie. And even if you're not a comic book fan, you're just gonna love this movie as an action movie. It has a little bit of a depth to it.
