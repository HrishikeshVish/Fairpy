Hey expo tv. 

I'm Dea and I watch a lot of movies. 

Obviously. 

I watch movies for no good reason. It seems interesting enough, I'll watch it. 

It seems not interesting at all, I'll still probably watch it if somebody recommends it to me. 

It has somebody that I like to watch in it, I'll watch it. 

(umm) I'm not very picky about these things. 

So I went ahead and picked up Gossip. 

Actually I think somebody borrowed it, borrowed it to me. 

Way to talk the English as well. {laugh} 

Somebody let me borrow it. And 

(uhh) interesting movie. 

The plot is basically about a couple of journalism students 

who as a sociological experiment, decide to start a rumor. 

And to track their rumor and to see what goes on how it changes, how it twists, how it turns. 

Who it turns on. 

{laugh} I didn't mean it in that way. {laugh} Hit the pause. 

Anyhow, (umm) James Marsden is in, is in this movie. He's cyclops from X-men, hello. 

Norman Reedus is also in here and you got to love him. I'll watch anything he's in. 

(uhh) Kate Hudson is in here, albeit for a few minutes, as is Joshua Jackson. 

But this isn't the greatest movie of all time ever. 

It, if it's on like sci-fi, 

I would say go ahead and watch it with one eye. 

But I wouldn't recommend that you go out right now and buy it or you'll die. You'll actually expire from not having it.
