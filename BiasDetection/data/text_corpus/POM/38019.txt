Hey my name's Scott and today I'm doing a review on a DVD that I probably should've rented before I went out and bought it. 

(umm)

Heard a lot of good reviews about it and a lot of people seem to love this movie,

but (umm) when I actually went out and 

bought the DVD and watched it, I was really disappointed.

(umm) I just really didn't like the movie too much.

(umm) I know a lot of people loved it and a lot of people think I'm crazy for not enjoying it, but

it just wasn't my kind of film.

(uhh) The storyline just kind of seemed to drag until it finally got into some action.

But (umm) this is,

(uhh) it has, it has (stutter) a decent amount of special features on it.

all different audios, in (uhh) Mandarin, (uhh) English, French, has subtitles in English and French,

(uhh) it has the "Making of" special,

a widescreen presentation,

a conversation with Michelle Yeoh featurette,

a photo montage, link to website, filmographies, animated menus, production notes, and (uhh) scene selections.

So, (umm)

it's been compared to like The Matrix in ways like that, with sword-fighting and things like that. (umm)

Just wasn't really my kind of film.

(umm) But, you know, you might want to give it a try. Might say to rent it before you buy the DVD though.

(uhh) But if you did like it and you don't have the DVD, definitely pick it up because it does have a lot of good special features.

That's (uhh) Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and (uhh)

give it a shot if you want.
