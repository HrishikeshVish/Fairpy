When I want to go and watch a movie I normally don't look for a Disney film, or a cartoon (umm) 

(uhh) I save that for little kids. Since I have no children of my own

I don't find myself enjoying those type of movies, or even seeing them for that matter. 

Lilo and Stitch, however, was one that my girlfriend wanted to see.

(umm) We went and saw it and it was actually extremely funny {clears throat}

There were a little, a few inside jokes that were (umm) 

aimed at adults yet still (uhh) innocent enough that children would not get the

somewhat matured sense of humor behind them. Lilo and Stitch is about an alien that was created against (uhh) interplanetary regulations and doomed to

spend life on (stutter), doomed to be destroyed when he escapes and makes it to Earth. 

He is deathly afraid of water and so when he gets trapped on Hawaii they find (uhh) they think that he's going to be easy to catch.

He finds (uhh) his way into a pound and a little girl 

(uhh) Lilo adopts him thinking that he's a dog. 

{clears throat}

In it Lilo is a bit of an outcast among the (stutter) more popular children and befriends Stitch who is obviously an alien. (umm) 

It's a very funny film, not just for children either, so I would recommend it.
