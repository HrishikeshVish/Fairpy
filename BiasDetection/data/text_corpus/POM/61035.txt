This is The Departed. (umm) This stars Leonardo Leonardo (stutter) DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. (umm) It's a pretty good (umm) action packed movie. (umm) This is rated R. (umm) And it's about (umm) a rookie cop who's Leonardo DiCaprio, (umm) and he grew up in a crime-filled neighborhood (umm) so he makes for a good mole. (umm) He then tries to (umm) get into Jack Nicholson's mob (umm) to try to find out (umm) things that are going on. (umm) But it's full of action packed adventure. (umm) And you kinda have to stay on your toes and, and (stutter) watch the movie (umm) or not leave for twenty movies and  think you can come back and know what it's about. But (umm) and it is (umm) a hundred and fifty-one minutes long. (umm) But I recommend picking this up, it's a really fun movie. (umm) And that is The Departed.
