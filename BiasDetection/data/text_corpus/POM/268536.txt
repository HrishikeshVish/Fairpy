Hi Expo Tv today I will be reviewing the movie The Love Guru. (uhh) This movie is being directed by Marco Schnabel and written by Mike Myers himself and Frank Gory.

(uhh)

As you know, this (uhh)

at the main time Mike Myers who you think of a comedy (umm) like Wayne's World (uhh) so you would expect to be, you would expect this to be hilarious but (uhh) in my expectation I was literally was kind of lost. (uhh) Am I really watching Mike Myer's movie? (uhh) thing is (uhh) That you (uhh)  Mike Myers is known for his different type of comedy style (uhh) but this movie  (uhh) like totally bizarre means you you (stutter) don't really understand some jokes which you are supposed to laugh but it's it's (stutter) pathetic. (uhh) In this movie you also see Jessica Alba, Justin Timberlake and (stutter) Verne Troyer. (uhh)

So the movie starts with (uhh) Mike Myers who (stutter) is playing the role of xxx and he's known as a love guru because (uhh) he help people to make their lives good. (uhh) So he, he (stutter) got kind of (uhh) job that he has to fix (uhh)

the life of a hockey player (uhh) (uhh)

to win the Stanley cup but (uhh) the way he do this stuff (uhh) like he has some goals in his mind that he has to tease that player to win (uhh) to work on, to all come all this difficulties. But (uhh) it really turns out to be rather dull. I I (stutter) just didn't like this movie. (uhh) Good a bitch. (uhh) Only thing I like about this movie was Jessica Alba she doesn't have (uhh) another big role just a short role. She was looking cute also. (uhh) In all I'm gonna give this movie like (uhh) maybe one out of five.

Again (uhh) my name is xxx and I have given a review for The Love Guru.
