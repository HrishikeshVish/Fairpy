Hey guys. I'm going to do the movie called Norbit.

(umm) I had a chance to huh catch this movie 

on a prerelease screening (umm) last week.

Thank goodness I did not pay for the movie.

It (uhh) stars Eddie Murphy. He plays several characters in the movie. (umm) He plays the main character

and he plays 

(umm) a big

a big obese woman in the character as well and 

you know, it's about him trying to win his true love, trying to impress this woman. Which is not that obese (stutter) obese woman in the movie that he also plays but 

that's another 

another actress who portrays his true love in the movie.

I mean after watching

(umm) The nutty Professor or Doctor Dolittle

(umm) those (stutter) movie were tolerable, but this movie was was (stutter) just out of the park. When I was watching this movie throughout throughout (stutter) in a in a (stutter) movie in the theater, I was just going what the heck

am I doing here?

(umm) I mean, 

the only thing I was impressed with the movie movie (stutter) was 

(umm) the fact that he he (stutter) played several different characters

(umm) at the same time in the movie.

(uhh) That was the only thing that I was 

(uhh) (uhh) 

you know

impressed with. Other than that the acting was 

(uhh) really really less than mediocre

and the story line is so cliche and you know, so over done.

I mean what happened to Eddie Murphy's 

(umm) career? I mean this is how low he's gonna go? How low can he sink any further? 

I hope he will get better roles 

(umm) than this movie.

(umm) This movie 

I mean, if you don't have to pay for the the (stutter) movie ticket for this 

(uhh) Norbit, I recommend it.

(umm) If not, don't catch it at all. It gets a thumbs down from me.
