What's up expo tv. I have a movie review for Superhero Movie. (uhh) Currently in theaters. 

It's about ninety minutes long and it's rated PG-thirteen for (uhh) 

crude and sexual content, comic violence, drug references, language. 

(uhh) It's from the makers of Scary Movie but this one's rated PG-thirteen. (uhh) I guess so more people can see it. It it's (stutter) not as good as the original Scary Movie, and it's not as good as pretty much any spoof movie. I thought it was kind of bad. (uhh) I guess the movie's about how

(uhh) how this kid named Rick gets bitten by this dragonfly and and (stutter) he becomes known as, like the dragonfly because he gets all these like, superpowers like he gets I guess like, he gets really strong, his skin gets like tough. And (uhh) it's just like I guess like (stutter) spoof on spiderman and pretty much every other superhero (stutter) movie that's currently out. (uhh) He goes off and fights crime against like this guy called

the hourglass. (uhh) Not that good of a movie as I said. It could have been a lot better. (uhh) It's like one of the most stupid comedies, like you don't really laugh that much, but, but (stutter) you laugh at some parts but as soon as it ends you're like, I just wasted like, ninety minutes of my life and like like (stutter) ten dollars. (uhh) So

I really don't recommend seeing it. Don't see it in the theaters. Do not see it on dvd. (uhh) Just completely ignore like

this movie. I don't get how these movies get put in like like (stutter) theaters, or like production even. Like who wants to do this. So (uhh) Superhero Movie, I would definitely give it a one out of five and I say stay away from this movie.
