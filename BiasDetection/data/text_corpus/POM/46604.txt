I'm (uhh)

sitting here trying to

figure out if I've ever seen a Wesley Snipes movie that I enjoyed. (umm)

I guess the answer is probably no, because (uhh)

this is maybe the (stutter) one of the worst movies I've seen him in so far, and that's saying a lot for (uhh) Wesley Snipes. This movie is called The Marksman, this is the DVD release. (uhh) It's ninety-five minutes long. There are no special features on here at all. (umm)

It is high-def but (uhh)

doesn't matter, it's a bad movie. (umm)

He plays a special forces soldier who has to go stop Russian terrorists at a nuclear power plant and (uhh) 

there, you've seen the whole movie.  

(uhh) 

Like I said, there's no special features on here. (uhh) I really didn't care that much because I wouldn't have wanted to see them anyway, but (uhh) this movie is just a real stinker. (uhh) Stay away from it.
