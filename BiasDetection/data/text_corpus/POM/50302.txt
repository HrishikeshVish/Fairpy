This is one my favorite movies, it's A League of Their Own. It's got a lot of

stars, and it's kind of old, so I think this was, 

well yeah they they (stutter) were stars then too. It's got like Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, and Madonna and (umm) and it's based on a true story from during world war two when the men went off to fight wars, and they needed women to play in major league baseball so that (umm) there would still be games going on. And (uhh) there's these sisters who love each other, but one is a little better player than the other, and it's really funny and it's really sweet. And I know this guy who's pretty tough and he does not cry in movies, he's only cried in one movie, and it was A League of Their Own {laugh}. It's a really sweet movie. (umm)

It's got this sticker on it because we got robbed and {laugh} the robber sold all our DVDs to a used shop so a lot of DVDs are marked, but (umm) a few got

bought before we got to the shop. I'm really glad they didn't buy this one because one of my favorites. I love this movie. It's sweet 

(umm) and it's historical.
