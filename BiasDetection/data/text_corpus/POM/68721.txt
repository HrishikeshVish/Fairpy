Hi I'm reviewing the Diary of a Mad Black Woman. The star is, this stars Tyler Perry and he also (uhh) made this movie. (uhh) It's knee-slapping, gut-busting crowd pleasers says Sean Edwards of Fox tv.

(uhh) It's very funny. It's funny and it's sad, it's got everything. It's got comedy, drama, action. Got everything in it. (uhh) It also says a spirited comedy, a hoot to watch and even more fun to talk about says Ruthie Stein of San Francisco Chronicle.

(uhh) It's PG-thirteen. It is

approximately a hundred-and-sixteen minutes long. It's got special features that include the widescreen version. Reflections on Diary, cut outtakes, Tyler Perry (stutter) commentary, the making of diary featurette, it's got a who's Tyler Perry. (uhh) And much more. But I recommend this movie and I think

(hmm)

(uhh) well probably kids probably wouldn't care about this, but but (stutter) it is funny, it's good for the grownups you know, Sit and watch this movie if you're having a bad day watch this and you'll laugh. You can find this at Amazon dot com for under twenty dollars.
