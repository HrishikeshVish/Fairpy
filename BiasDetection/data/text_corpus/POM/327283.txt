So this is a movie review on Inception starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (umm) I wasn't very excited going in to see this movie. (umm) It was

my friend's choice to go see this movie. I hadn't even seen the previews for it. But I wasn't going to complain. And

I just, I'm very glad that this is what my friends chose to see. It was such an amazing movie. My mind was like completely blown with the, with the movie, with the twists, with everything. (umm) I'm not really the biggest Leonardo DiCaprio fan but he did an amazing job and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just an extremely (uhh)

flexible actor, he's very versatile, he can play a lot of different roles. (umm) Seeing him in Five Hundred Days of Summer didn't

make me believe that he was going to do a good job on such serious role as this one, but I was definitely proven wrong. (umm) The ending, oh the ending is just, it's crazy. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and kind of angers you too. This movie gets you so, it makes you think, you know. (umm) Inception (umm) is explained in the movie to be

going into somebody's dream and planting an idea in their mind that grows with them. And it just like changes who they are and how they feel about life and things. (umm) Like I said, it was an amazing movie, (uhh) definitely a five out of five. Actually it was more like a ten out of five. It was so good that it's, it's (stutter) a movie you have to see. (uhh) So definitely check that one out when you have the time.
