Ten thousand B.C. (umm) I'm not sure what I miss more, the five dollars I spent to go see it or the two hours I spent watching it. (umm)

This movie was absolutely abysmal, is the only word I can think of to describe it. (umm)

Just the first line of the movie was just, it was just ridiculous. It was (umm)

(uhh)

The only err only time will tell the difference between legend and truth, and you're just like, what the heck does that even mean? Does that Mean that this whole movie is just a lie?

Anyways, (umm) this movie follows the story of (umm) this one guy who's like the chosen ,you know, guy, to like overthrow these Egyptians. I don't, it's really unclear, as they go from like Himalayas to like, a rain forest to a desert in like three days, just walking. And it's just

it's, it's (stutter) really ridiculous and then there's there's (stutter). Okay there's this one part where like, where he's in like, this pit, and there's like a saber-toothed tiger in there and he was just like, I'm gonna kill you. Aww but wait, you're sort of trapped in these sticks,

I'm not gonna kill you so don't kill me. And the saber-toothed tiger is like, alright that's cool.

I don't know. Anyways, the xxx in it like, weren't even that cool and I mean there were like,

mammoths, CGI mammoths that were sorta neat I guess. It wasn't visually that stunning. (umm) The girl wasn't even like that attractive.

It was just an overall disappointment but, I mean it was funny to see just cause we could make fun of it afterwards. But other than that, (umm) sort of a waste of time and money. Yeah, ten thousand B.C.
