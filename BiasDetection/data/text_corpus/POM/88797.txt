Here we have Stealth. 

This movie was pretty predictable, 

and, not that entertaining.  

I mean, it has all the big names in it that you've heard before.  

(umm) Josh Lucas, Jessica Beil, and Jamie Foxx. 

However, I don't know, it just lacked a lot of

good, in the movie.  

I (stutter) without a better word good. (umm), I don't know if it was the screenplay or what, 

but this movie just wasn't very memorable and not very captivating.  

(umm) The whole premise of this movie is that (umm), the government has made an AI plane, 

which that means (stutter) artificial intelligence. That (uhh),

plane is very smart, and learns, 

and it put it together with this three man team, the three characters on the front 

to go on missions and then as the premise of the movie begins,

it goes haywire.  

So, from that point, I'll let you decide, but that's just on the back, the back (stutter) of the thing.  

I'm not ruining anything for you.  

I don't think it's possible.  

The movie ruins it for itself.  

So, I'd probably give it a, one out of five.  Not good at all.
