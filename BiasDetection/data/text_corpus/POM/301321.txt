Hi, I'm here to talk about the movie Inglourious Basterds. (umm) It is a Quentin Tarantino movie. It is about a group of Jewish (stutter) soldiers led by Brad Pitt that go into Germany in World War Two and attempt to

kill Hitler and take out as many Nazis

while they can, including scalping them. And it is

a great (stutter) it's so Tarantino. There is various plotlines going on at the same time. Just as this plotline is going on there's another plotline of (uhh) a Jewish (uhh) refugee or (umm)

a Jewish girl living (uhh) under an assumed named who owns a theater that ends up have a nazi night and (umm) she plots to kill a bunch of Nazis too. (umm) It's not at all historically accurate but

it's a, it's an (stutter) absolutely great film. Just stunning dialogue in so many languages. I think there's there's (stutter) English, there's French, there's German in it and just amazing acting all around. (uhh) Just an outstanding cast. Not only do the leads like Brad Pitt and (umm) Diana Kruger, or Diane Kruger, (umm) just shine but every single actor in that movie is just absolutely perfect. And it's, it's (stutter) really brutal too. There are a lot of really brutal scalping scenes and (umm) it's just

it's if you're a Tarantino fan you're obviously going to fall in love with it but if you're and you're a history fan you will probably fall in love with it even though it's wrong, or it's it's (stutter) inaccurate. But (umm) yes, absolutely great. It's stunningly (stutter) it's probably the most

rich visual movie that he's ever made so far. (umm) The the (stutter) places where it's filmed are just beautiful and (stutter) everything, every character is so well developed and it's just an amazing movie so I'd highly recommend Ingloruious Basterds to

pretty much everybody. So I

highly recommend it.
