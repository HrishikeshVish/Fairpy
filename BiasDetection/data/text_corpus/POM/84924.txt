Hey expotv. I'm Dia, and 

this right here is 

The Hot Chick. This is not the kind of movie that I would normally watch. I only really watched it because my sister and my cousin were like oh my god this movie is so funny, you gotta see it. And I didn't really have anything else to do so I kind of sat down and I watched it with them. And the fact is that it was pretty funny, but it was funny in that sort of like mindless comedy kind of way where it's not very smart, but it can be pretty funny and like (stutter) at some points it's kind of cute and, you know, it has a point or a moral. 

So you can't hate it 

because it's not, it's not (stutter) complete garbage but it's not exactly like, you know, the best movie you've ever seen. But like I said it was fun to watch. (umm) 

The whole premise of the movie is that Rob Schneider and (uhh) I can't remember the actress's name. I believe it's the girl who's in Mean Girl. Rachel McAdams, is that her? She, they switch bodies and (umm) you know hilarity ensues. She she (stutter) who's in his body has to convince everybody that it's still her and, like I said, funny but I wouldn't buy it. Like if it's on Comedy Central I would suggest that you go ahead and check it out, but you know otherwise it's not exactly something that you need to add to your video collection.
