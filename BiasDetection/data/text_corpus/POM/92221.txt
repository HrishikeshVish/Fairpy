Hi. My name is Mary and today I'll be reviewing Evan Almighty, which is a movie that recently came out in movie theaters. And (umm) it's basically a sequel to Bruce Almighty. It's about this guy who, named Evan Baxter, who is newly elected to Congress, and he's a newscaster. And (umm) and he is next one that is anointed by God to (uhh) do a holy mission. So he leaves Buffalo behind and goes to (uhh) Virginia, where, with his family. And then there he gets the order from God to (umm) build an ark. So he has to go find animals. And his family is, like, incredibly confused. They don't know if he's having a midlife crisis or if he really is 

(umm) you know, destined for (stutter) something great.

(umm) Honestly, oh, oh, yeah. And there's two different (umm) I mean, there's a bunch of different names for this movie. It's also known as Bruce Almighty two (umm) Bruce Almighty sequel, and The Passion of the Ark. 

But, yeah, it's about ninety minutes long. So it's not very long at all. And, honestly, it was just, it's rated PG too, but, honestly, it really wasn't that good, {laugh} in my opinion. I didn't think Bruce Almighty was that good, and Evan Almighty is the same except a little bit worse. So I would not recommend it.

All right. Thanks.
