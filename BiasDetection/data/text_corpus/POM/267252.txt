What's up expo tv. (uhh) I have a review for a movie called The Happening. (uhh) This movie recently came out about two weeks ago. It's and it's (stutter) rated R for violent violent (stutter) images. (uhh) It's like a, it's starring Mark Wahlberg. (uhh) That's all I really recognize from the movie. And it's from like the producer of (uhh) or,

of like (uhh) Signs and this, (stutter) Sixth Sense. And (uhh) the movie is about how there's this like, (stutter) parent, this like, random thing and just, (stutter) like threating off like like like (stutter) it, like basically every person. And it's just making them do crazy stuff and like everyone's just like dying and stuff it's really, really weird. (uhh)

But it was interesting but it was like kind of like, this can't be happening like, what like, what's going on why are all these people just going crazy. Because like, just something in the like, air or something. So I thought it was kind of like weird. But you but you (stutter) guys might like it. (uhh)

It was

I guess it was like definitely along the lines of Signs and like Sixth Sense, of those movies.
But it wasn't as good. It was just like, a little bit more like violent and I guess that's why it they rated it R. But (uhh) it's not like scary, it doesn't really freak you out or, or nike huarache so myself so if you're looking to go see a scary movie, do not see this this (stutter) movie. It's not good.

So so so (stutter) I would have to give The Happening a two out of five.

(uhh) That's all I have to say.
