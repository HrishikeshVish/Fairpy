I'm reviewing The American Wedding. This is a really funny movie. (umm) It is rated R, there's strong sexual content in this movie throughout the whole movie actually. (umm)

It's really funny. (umm) It's basically it's (umm) (uhh) the third movie in this series the American Pie (umm) this is where they have a wedding. (umm) And it's Alyssa Hannigan (umm) and Jason Biggs (umm) they end up getting married. (umm) So it's kinda a story about how they get the wedding together. (umm) They call upon their friends (umm) they help them out and while helping them out, (umm) they also hurt them. (umm) And all the mischievous stuff that they get into. (umm) So it's a really good movie it's really, really funny. And I do recommend seeing this movie. (umm) It is rated R so it's really not appropriate for children at all. And so that's American Wedding.
