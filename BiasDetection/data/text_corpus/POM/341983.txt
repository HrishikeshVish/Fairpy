Hey there Expoers. Today I'm reviewing the movie

Elf. This is by far my favorite Christmas movie. It's so good that I even watch it when it's not Christmas. Here's the little proof of

purchase there. Get the DVD. I've had this one. It's just one of those movies that you just gotta own, you know? I mean it's just so funny

and (uhh)

I mean my favorite part has gotta be the aww man there's just so many good ones. When, I mean when he tried to give that raccoon a hug and

it attacks him, and when he picks the chewing gum off, and

when he buys his father that special something. I mean, that's just, that's good stuff. Will Ferrell in this movie.

Funniest man alive. (uhh) this is back when, you know, he was sort of starting his movie runs but (uhh) just such a great, very kid friendly too. (umm)

he didn't do anything stupid because a lot of these days people you know they're adding some like just things that aren't really needed in (uhh)

and you know they're just, they're just (stutter) dumb inappropriate things that they throw in these movies nowadays and so. This is just a nice clean movie and it's just hilarious and fun and cute and you know.

It's a great family movie so (uhh) we watch it every year at Christmas so I (uhh) hope you enjoy the review and go out and see Elf. Rent it or Netflix or something. It's a great movie.

Bye guys. Thanks.
