A lot of directors really want to (uhh) 

{cough} really want to (uhh) continue a tradition if they make a movie that's a hit, Sam Raimi decided to continue this tradition on a movie that wasn't quite a hit. (uhh) Evil Dead two, the book of the dead edition (uhh)

is a continuation of the original Evil Dead, or (uhh) is a sequel to the original Evil Dead. It actually follows the same storyline as the Evil Dead. However, (uhh)

it's done a little bit differently and actually makes way for (uhh) Army of Darkness which is the next in the series. {cough} In it, it follows Ash, who (uhh) with a group of friends camps out into, in a cabin in the woods and uncovers the book of the dead, an ancient Syrian text that is (uhh) containing resurrection (stutter) passages.

He (stutter) excuse me, accidentally (uhh) opens up a portal to evil and unleashes it upon the world. (uhh) He battles it as it possesses his friends the woods around him, and even his own hand, which he lops off and then replaces with a chainsaw.

Movie, the acting, comical over the top but done on purpose. Most movies that are like that, (uhh)

they're not done on purpose, they're done solely to (uhh)

solely trying to be serious but end up being bad. This when it's on purpose ends up making it funnier. One last word for the book of the dead. {movie}
