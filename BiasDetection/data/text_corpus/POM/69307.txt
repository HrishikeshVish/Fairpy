This is Grave of the Fireflies. Now this is one of the most highly regarded anime actual films, not just series, because it's very serious and incredibly well done. This stars (umm) two orphans who try and survive the Japanese countryside following a World War Two bombing. And it's just an incredibly touching movie.

The dvd is very well done and it looks very good, sounds nice. And the special features are top notch, instead of being traditional kind of Hollywood special features where you just (uhh) find the cast and crew and everyone says how much they love the movie, it takes a more,

I guess an intelligent view on features. It gives you a historical perspective commentary where you can watch the movie and hear about how the actual,

(uhh) how it was in the actual times, just finding out about how difficult it would be around World War Two the bombings and so on. It includes some things such as (uhh) video restoration. Because the film itself was probably not in the best condition so they show you how they fix it just really well done well thought out stuff here. It does have storyboards with alternate angles. Not really deleted scenes, just kind of alternate takes of the existing scenes. And those can be interesting cuz some of them give you kind of a new perspective on a few scenes.

I'm giving Grave of the Fireflies a five out of five.
