Hey expo tv I'm Dea and as a rule I love superhero movies, I've said that before. 

(umm) I love everything about them, the cheese factor, the action sequences, the whole thing. 

However there are

there are (stutter) some of, some exceptions to that rule. As to all rules.

(umm) One of the exceptions to my rule is Daredevil.

This is very likely one of the worst {laugh} movies of all time.

Okay, I'm not saying this out of hatred or to be stylish.

But Ben Affleck is seriously a black hole of talent.

Because no matter how many awesome people you put in a movie, Ben Affleck can suck any good out of it. It's true.

There are a couple movies that Ben Affleck is in that I I (stutter) actually like. And I don't personally, I don't have like a vendetta against him, I don't hate him or anything.

I, he's not one of those people like, if he's in a movie I refuse to watch it. There are a couple of those people.

But it just seems like anytime Ben Affleck's in a movie, it's just bad.

Anytime like post the nineties at least.

(umm) I mean a ton of really cool people are in here.

Jennifer Garner plays Elektra Nacho, or as we like to call her, electric nachos.

(umm) She, as cool as Jennifer Garner is, and as hot as she looks in all this leather,

she still cannot

fight the sucktasticism

that is Ben Affleck. It's sad. (umm)

Michael Clark Duncan is in here and we all know he's stone cold cool.

And so is Colin Farrell.

And like, I like Colin Farrell.

But this movie's just not good and I highly suspect that it's because of the Ben Affleck.

And his

black holeyness of talent.
