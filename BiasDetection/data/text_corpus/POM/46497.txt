I've got to wonder 

who out there is 

watching Steven Seagall movies. I mean obviously I watched this because 

I hate myself. 

But (uhh) 

somebody out there 

has to be buying these 

and (uhh) actually enjoying them, 

so that they continue to buy more of them because he keeps on making movies and I can't figure it out because 

they're terrible. 

And (uhh) 

I have to actually restrain myself 

on the couch 

before I put the movie (uhh) 

on play to watch it because otherwise 

I just end up throwing whatever I can find at the tv 

in an effort to (uhh) (stutter) break it whatever, 

his smug fat face comes on the camera. (uhh) 

I guess I should get to the point this movie Black Dawn, 

(uhh) he plays a ex-CIA agent, 

(uhh) has to (uhh) 

stop terrorists from releasing a nuclear weapon. 

(uhh) It sounds like a million other movies and it's just like a million other movies 

except somehow worse.
