My name is Eric Nederland.

And I am reviewing the movie Twenty-Seven Dresses for Expo Tv dot com.

Yes.

I did see this movie.

Not by my own choice, I was forced to.

It was everything you might expect from such a movie. Romantic comedy, about a woman who has been a bridesmaid twenty-seven times.

Now, 

I don't know about you, 

but I don't think I'm going to be a wedding attendant twenty-seven times and I don't know how many people really will be. That in itself was a little bit unbelievable. But unfortunately that was one of the more believable plot points.

Now, I don't have anything against the actors, the director, I just don't think it was a movie that was worth being made.

Everything was romantic comedy-ish.

It was cliched. Unbelievable leaps of

the imagination you have to suspend your disbelief like,

I don't know.

Like an elephant was stepping on your pants.

If you like that sort of thing,

go see it.

If not,

run the other direction as fast as you can.
