I am going to review Twilight the movie. I will say I didn't really get into the Twilight books right away. (umm) I saw the movie first because I, it looked good from what I saw in the previews and I decided to give it a try once it came on pay per view. And I loved the movie and I decided to read the books afterward.  And I will say that

there is, you know, obviously stuff left out in the books, but it still keeps very true to the books, down to there's a scene in here in the lunchroom where you get the front cover of the book (umm) with the two hands holding an apple. (umm) It does have a lot of the lines in it and it is a very good movie, you know, true to life. (uhh) The characters I think were portrayed very well and (umm)

this one does have, you know, some pretty good extended features, down to the music videos, audio commentary, extended scenes, deleted scenes, (umm)

and it does show (uhh) the Comic-Con phenomenon on here (umm) of the Twilight phenomenon and more. (uhh) So it's definitely a great, a great (stutter) movie to watch and to to (stutter) own if you've already seen it.
