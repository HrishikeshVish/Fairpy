Russell Crowe is a great actor. He, 

hands down, is one of the best and so that's why I recommend watching Gladiator. 

(uhh) It stars obviously Russell Crowe and interesting enough Joaquin Phoenix. 

(umm) Both characters

put on an amazing show of (uhh) great acting and

it's set in the background in Rome (umm) 

This movie is visually spectacular. I think Ridley Scott directs it. (uhh)

Ridley Scott has directed (uhh) Kingdom of Heaven and Blade Runner so he knows what he is doing. 

This movie is surely breathtaking. There are some scenes 

that are so visually stunning that they will make you want to rewind it just for the scenery 

(umm) 

Set this movie takes place 

everywhere between Rome to the deserts of Africa 

to the lands of Germ (stutter) Germany so if you want an adventure 

that has action, (uhh) 

drama, and love. Then you want this movie. (umm) 

This movie doesn't glorify violence like three hundred. 

It just makes it, 

uses violence to

to (stutter) (uhh) make the most 

largest effect on the viewer. (umm) It is rated R, it's about two hours long (uhh) 

I personally bought my copy for about twelve dollars and I am not sad about it. It's definitely worth every penny.
