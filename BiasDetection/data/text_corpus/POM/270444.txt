Hey expotv, today I'm gonna review the movie that's currently in theaters (umm) and that movie would be Hellboy Two. (umm) Hellboy Two,

I wasn't all that excited to go see this but you know, people are going to see it so I was like, whatever I'll go and

it definitely didn't live up to even my low expectations. I thought it was worse than what I thought it would be. (umm) By the way the subtitle to this movie is Hellboy Two and the Golden Army. Pretty much it's more just rampaging through

Hellboy beating people down and saying clever little phrases. (umm)

I don't know, something about the whole Hellboy theme I don't really like, personally. You know, it's another one of these blockbusters from a comic book. 

So you know if you're a, if you're (stutter) a Hellboy fan you'll probably like it actually, but if you're just a general viewer I highly doubt you'll enjoy it, just because you don't really have any connection to it and it's just not good. If you don't have a connection it probably won't be good cause it's it's (stutter) just annoying.

Really all I can say is I was bored with this movie about halfway through and then just started getting annoyed with all the (umm)

kind of the, like the little lines and I mean it does have pretty good graphics and like explosions and stuff, but even those can't make up for its lack of anything else, so I give it one out of five stars for Hellboy and the Golden army.
