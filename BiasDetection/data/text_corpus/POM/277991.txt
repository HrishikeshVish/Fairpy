Hello. I'd like to tell you about a movie that a friend took me to see and I didn't really like that much. The movie is called Quarantine and the the (stutter) general plot is it's kind of a,

you know, a horror flick. (uhh) People traveling are trapped in a hotel that's been quarantined for an unknown reason and they're slowly getting, you know, picked off one at a time. Now that plot may sound familiar, I know I've seen it in a dozen other movies and frankly (uhh) none of them are that good. There's just not enough to work with there, I mean,

sounds like a good place to build up some tension but they really didn't do a job in this movie. It doesn't star anybody that I've ever heard of and

I just think it was done very, very poorly. You know, you almost can tell anybody goes outside or comes up with a great idea or something that something bad is going to happen to them immediately, it's pretty obvious, and when it's obvious it's not scary. You can pretend (uhh)

to scream and, you know, yell at the screen with your friends but really you all know what's going to, to (stutter) happen so xxx is the kind of movie you go to make fun of with your friends but I don't really want to pay, you know, eight bucks to do that so if you are interested in this film I'd definitely wait for it to come out on video and (uhh) I really don't think that you're gonna get much out of it except for maybe a laugh, but definitely not a scare.
