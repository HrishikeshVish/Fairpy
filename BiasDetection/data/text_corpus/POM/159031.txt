Hey how you doing, my name is Roger. Wanna tell you a little bit about a movie I saw in a theater not too long ago. (umm) It was Live Free or Die Hard. Which was (umm) Bruce Willis' new movie. And actually this is the third movie in the trilogy of (umm) the Die Hard movies. And {cough} what (umm) what the the (stutter) fun thing of this movie is it did not disappoint you, it was a very action-packed movie from the very beginning, and it and it (stutter) picks up with (umm) Bruce Willis playing the same character played in the first two, except he's a lot older and he's got a daughter that's a lot older. And so he's actually in a (umm)

keeping other things in mind besides just himself. (umm) It is very action-packed, it was (umm) you know, from the beginning to the end, everything from people getting blown up to fighting, to (umm) I mean a typical (stutter) Bruce Willis type movie in that way. (umm) It was very entertaining, very good, it followed very good storyline, very good plot. (umm) So I would recommend that you go and get it, it is rated PG-thirteen which is a little bit different than his rated R movies for the first two Die Hards. (umm) Most of the language was not like like (stutter) it was before, which was a plus to me, I enjoyed that. (umm) Still had a little bit in there but it wasn't over the top, it wasn't that bad. So if you get a chance go and see (stutter) Live Free Or Die Hard with Bruce Willis. Okay, thanks.
