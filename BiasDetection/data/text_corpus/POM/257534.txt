Hey, ExpoTV. Today I'm here to talk about the movie Boarding Gate. (umm) Watching this movie is probably one of the biggest wastes of my time (umm) in recent memory. (umm) I should have known that going in, but I didn't listen. (umm) What this movie is about is Asia Argento, who plays an ex-prostitute. (umm) And she's forced (umm) to flee England, (umm) London (umm) after a {sigh} bad encounter (umm) during one of her jobs. And (uhh), as you can tell, the movie is already completely ridiculous and not something you want to watch. (umm) But she's forced to flee, and she takes up with a different couple. And, you know, they promise to get her her (stutter) passport, her visa, all the necessary papers (umm) obviously in exchange for services. (umm) And it basically turns out to be a manipulation on the couple's end against Sandra.

(umm) So a completely ridiculous story. (umm) No value in watching this at all. You don't learn anything from this movie. You don't get a good feeling afterwards. (umm) After watching it, I just felt a little bit sick, a little bit disgusted, like why did I just waste my time watching that? (umm) So I think most people would get that feeling after seeing this. Like I said, there's really nothing that sticks out that would be even remotely good about this movie. (umm) Even the acting is poor. (umm) So thumbs way down for Boarding Gate, one out of five stars.
