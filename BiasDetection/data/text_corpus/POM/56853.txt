Hi.

(umm) the product that I'm going to review today is the movie by Stiven Spielborg,

instead, Steven Spielberg. {laughs}

It's called Innerspace. 

(umm) this stars 

Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, and Meg Ryan. 

It's a comedy, a romantic comedy about a  

(umm) a guy,

Dennis Quaid, who gets

shrunk

in a machine, and he was initially supposed to be injected to into a science rabbit.

(umm) it was an experiment that they were doing.

Instead something happened and (umm),

I believe the science lab where they were 

starting this experiment was broken into at the time 

by another corporation or another (umm) guy who wanted to

steal this information before

(uhh) Dennis Quaid and his team could

complete the mission. 

And (uhh) what happens is that

one of the scientists that has Dennis Quaid in, injection needle runs off and then somehow injects Dennis Quaid and his machine into Martin Short, 

and (umm)

it's just a story of how they tried to save (uhh) Dennis Quaid

from

dying inside of Martin Short's body.

It's 

It's (stutter) funnier {laughs} 

then what I'm actually telling you. 

But (umm) I

I definitely recommend this movie. You can find it at Amazon dot com or D DVD (stutter) Discounts for under twenty dollars.
