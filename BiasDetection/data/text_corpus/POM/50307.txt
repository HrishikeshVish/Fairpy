This might be the

most underappreciated Disney movie ever created. 

Ever. 

(umm) it's an awesome movie but it flopped in the box offices, but (stutter)

it killed during (umm) 

when they were in video and DVD sales. It's awesome.

This is Newsies, and it stars Christian Bale when he was like

fifteen. He's amazing singer, dancer, actor. 

Even though he's got a British accent in real life, he has a New York accent in this movie.

There's the kid from Doogie Howser, Doogie's friend in here who, he's an amazing tap dancer, who would have guessed?

It's a musical and it's based on a true story from (umm) 

ninteen-o-one, nineteen-hundred kind of times in New York when there were orphaned boys who would sell newspapers.

From (umm) for

The World and The Journal. 

And (umm) they were trying, the newspaper was trying to make more money, so they were gouging the paperboys. 

And they have no leader, no union, but they organize and rebelled and they 

(umm) and they united and it's really sweet, there's amazing choreography, 

especially since they're just young boys, you don't expect them to be good dancers.
