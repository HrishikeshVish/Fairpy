Hey, 

this is a review 

of the movie Firehouse Dog 

which is currently in theaters. (umm) 

Yeah, it, it (stutter) shouldn't be. It's (uhh) 

kind of a disgrace 

to Hollywood. 

To (umm) 

the human race in general. It is a 

horrible, horrible movie. 

(umm) Don't waste your time. 

If you want (umm) 

something more exciting you could perhaps stare at a wall 

or throw yourself down a flight of stairs. 

Something to that effect it might (uhh) 

might be a better use of your time. (uhh) The plot 

runs weak. 

The acting was horrible. 

(umm) Yeah just a terrible movie all around I wish I had never seen it. 

(umm) 

You should buy a DVD just to destroy it, but (umm) 

if you don't have that much money don't bother. 

(umm) I don't. I'm not going to, screw that. (umm) 

Yeah terrible movie.
