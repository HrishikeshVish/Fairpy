Hi, today I'm going to do a movie currently in theaters for view for you of a movie called ten thousand B.C. (umm) ten thousand B.C. is about (umm) you know, it takes place in ten thousand B.C. (umm) A prehistoric culture (umm) and it kind of revolves around a young man who is hunting mammoths and (umm) trying to save his tribe. This movie though, this movie is absolutely awful. I (umm)

I couldn't recommend this to anybody. There's all kinds of things going around that don't seem to actually make any sense,(umm) especially in regards to historical accuracy. (umm) Number one, you've got you know pyramids being built, you've got vultures on like mammoths and you've got people of different kinds of (umm) races sometimes, it's just like

ten thousand B.C., this is not probable. (umm) It's not true

and (umm) the movie is really terrible. They don't develop into the characters at all. (umm) Throughout the duration of the movie I don't feel a sense to any of the characters. And also the acting is just some of the worst acting I've ever seen. And If I could say this (umm)

{laugh} just

save your money. Save your eight, nine, ten dollars. Whatever the movie rate is in your city and do not go see ten thousand B.C. There's probably a lot of other movies playing right now that you would enjoy more than ten thousand B.C. So again, (umm) this is my review for ten thousand B.C. Do not go see it, it's really awful.
