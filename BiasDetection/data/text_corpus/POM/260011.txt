What's up Expo. I've got a Denzel Washington movie right here, Out of Time.

Didn't like this movie. I'm a huge Denzel fan. I love every Denzel movie I think he's an amazing actor. And he, he (stutter) is a good actor in this movie. (umm) 

Like he plays his character well. It's not

that, I just don't like the movie. The movie's terrible. He plays his character good. He still

is an amazing actor. (umm) But this movie was not very good. (umm) It's got Eva Mendes in it though, which is, she's beautiful you know that. And Sanaa Lathan from Blade, and Dean Cain from Lois and Clark and Ripley's Believe It Or Not. So if you're into any of those, those (stutter) people I mean check it out. I didn't like it but that doesn't mean you won't. (umm)

It's a cop story. Denzel's the, the good guy. Look at him on the cover. He's the good guy but. I just, I wasn't feeling Out of Time. Maybe you will though.
