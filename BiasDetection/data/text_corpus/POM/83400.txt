There's some films that are really comical and just rather funny without meaning to be. One such film is Reign of Fire. This film {clears throat} is about a dragon even though there's about eight seconds total of dragon in the entire film. A dragon population that takes over the world. It's set in England (umm)

and it's mainly in a castle where a few survivors live and just scratch on day by day. They don't really live, it's just survive. (umm) {clears throat} The scene takes a twist with Matthew McConaughey, 

I'm sorry, Matthew Slab of Beef McConaughey enters the (uhh) scene as a (uhh) US (uhh)

military man that is trying to combat the dragons. He's developed a plan to destroy them and he is relying on the inhabitants of the castle to help carry it out. {clears throat}

The acting is over the top, shoddy, hilariously done even though it's not meant to be. As far as a serious film? Do not rent this. But if you're looking for something to make fun of (uhh) I would definitely (umm) 

definitely pick this up just to sit around and poke fun of. The best scene is when Matthew McConaughey's character finally speaks and you ask yourself "wow, you're really going with that character?" So (uhh)

view with discretion.
