Hello I'm Matthew and I'm here to tell you about this dvd movie. (umm) It's called Con Air. It stars the actors (umm) Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and John Malkovich.

(umm) This is a

all the way action movie.

The storyline is that a group of prisoners are being transferred by plane

and the plane crashes and they have to (umm) defend themselves

(umm) to escape and they're trying to repair the plane so they can escape. (umm) Nicolas Cage does play a good guy and he tries to stop them although he is a prisoner (umm) he is a good prisoner. And he tries to stop them from escaping. (umm) John Cusack plays a police officer. (umm) There's lots of explosions in this. (umm) Lots of actions, lots of shooting. (umm) The runtime is a hundred and fifteen minutes and it has a trailer of the movie and also has some pictures (umm) that's about it as far as the bonus features. But for about seven dollars nowadays (umm) depending if you get it

on sale or not, (umm) this is a great action movie and especially if you like Nicolas Cage.
