This time I've got a major motion picture DVD review, this is the cinematic excellence known as Donny Darko the director's cut.

This movie is amazing, it it's (stutter) for a lot of people it's very confusing because they don't quite understand temporal anomalies which the movie explains to some general degree but, perhaps it's just my love of 

temporal anomalies and physical or physics impossibilities and what not that I love it.

The acting in this is amazing this of course stars Jake Gyllenthal so (umm) Gyllethaal jall  (stutter) whatever you know what I mean 

(umm) and as well as (uhh) other little (umm) other 

(uhh) lesser roles (umm) as (umm) Drew Barrymore and even (uhh) Jake Gyllenhaal's sister Maggie Gyllenhaal (umm) this is just an (stutter) amazing movie mainly because (umm) 

it's it's (stutter) science fiction but it's drama at the same time this'll make you feel a lot of emotions that you don't quite understand all at once,
 
so (umm) it's definitely one to watch (uhh) preferably with friends (umm) but but (stutter) it's definitely something to watch not necessarily a party movie like hey bring out the beer, put on a movie, no it's not that type of movie

(umm) you you (stutter) will just be almost twitching afterwards just because of the (uhh) the things that it can (umm)

if you understand or things that you understand or try to understand the thing's that it presents so (uhh) it's it's (stutter) a very (umm) an just an amazing movie, (uhh) time travel, science fiction, (uhh) 

life and death, parallel universes all of this is covered in this movie but without having like an over like oh Stargate or something type of (uhh) (stutter) science science fiction feel to it or something, so definitely check this out you will not be sorry  

(uhh) (uhh) pretty much everyone who has seen this movie has loved it so it's a it's a (stutter) little weird but especially (stutter) the Director's cut it adds a lot of cool scenes to it as well as some director's commentary if you're into that (umm) 

so definitely check it out, it is not one to miss.
