I'm doing my review on Pink Floyd The Wall featuring Bob Geldof and it is rated R for adult content, nudity 

profanity, and whatever else you could imagine. You have to at least watch this movie one time in a life, you know. It's 

just 

an really strange movie. You probably even have to watch it as many as three times to figure out half of it.

(umm) I would say that all in all, you would just have to see it to believe it. It's very 

(umm) it's set I guess where a person is on drugs

and, in the trance or daydreaming or all of the above and it's about the adventures or daydreams or activities in a person's mind 

that they would dream about under the influence of drugs and it's really wild because you just could not believe half the things that happened to the guy. 

So, I would recommend watching it, in moderation.
