Hey how's it going? I'm Pat and I'm reviewing the movie Rounders.

Now 

it's funny. 

With Rounders, a lot of people think I look like Edward Norton. I actually don't think I look like him at all, but some people do. Edward Norton is a great actor. He's in this movie Rounders. Rounders is about 

(umm) a couple guys that are incredibly good at poker that try to swindle a lot of people at getting money

where (uhh) 

Edward Norton plays a character that just gets out of jail, has to pay a lot of gambling debts and Matt Damon's character has to come in

and do all this rounding which is playing poker and getting money from all these people to to  (stutter) pay off his debt. There's some swings, there's some swings back and forth. And 

(uhh) eventually, you know, it's actually a very good movie. Especially if you're an avid poker player because

there's a lot of different poker things. Poker topics that happen in this movie.

(uhh) It's one of my favorites. 

(uhh) It's a very funny movie. Lot of twists and turns.

(uhh) You know, again, if you're really into poker, it's a very good time.

(uhh) Matt Damon's pretty good in the movie. He's a good actor, and so is (uhh) Edward Norton. 

(umm) I just love the movie.
