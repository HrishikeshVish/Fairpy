This is Matrix, the original, and this is an awesome show. I don't know how many times I went to the theater to see this. 

I was going to the theater every chance I could all by myself, just sitting there, sometimes I was the only one in the theater watching it. 

You know, it's just, it's such, the visuals was just so, so new and and (stutter) different when it first came out and the story line was really intriguing to me and I would sit there and try to, you know, just 

figure things out and think about it and just I loved watching the visuals. And (umm) 

this stars Keanu Reeves and Lawrence (uhh) Fishburne and (umm)

it's about Neo who's a a (stutter) computer genius and (umm)

it's also about a world that is really not what people think it is and (umm) it's a whole scheme by these powerful machines to make people think that they're living their lives, but they're not. And so it's a really interesting story and this DVD has (umm), let's see, I don't think it has that many features really. 

(uhh) It has behind the scenes. (uhh)

It has (umm)

music track of the follow the right rabbit and take the red pills 

and (uhh) it says here "For mysterious mind-bending extras". 

I don't know what that means, I haven't watched that. 

(uhh) There's an exclusive chatroom with celebrity guests and other special events. So this movie was an hour and thirty-six minutes but if you haven't watched this first one you ought to watch it. I mean I can, I can (stutter) still watch it but now I have to watch it, I I (stutter) mean

I have to watch it every, you know, once a year maybe. But {clears throat} the other part two and part three {clears throat} kind of ruined it for me. 

So but I really like this, the original. The Matrix. You can get it at Amazon dot com.
