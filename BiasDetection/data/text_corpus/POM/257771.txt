Hi I'm Tom and today I'm gonna be reviewing the movie ten thousand BC. As validation here is my movie ticket which kinda got crumpled in my pocket I apologize.

There we go, yeah, front pocket. (umm)

Okay this movie bothered me a lot just because it was really not historically accurate. But I don't know if they were trying to set out for that but that's the part that just confuses me. (uhh) Special effects were great but the cast that, you knew nobody. (umm)

It it's (stutter) a good movie.

It it (stutter) follows the story of this 

(stutter) mammoth hunter and it, trying to do better for his tribe, or trying to get his tribe a better life. (umm) It's got a lot of really good action. They were trying to push this as a like, the next big epic movie just like three hundred but no it didn't come anywhere close and the best part is, if you (uhh) look back to the release dates, three hundred was released the same weekend just a year prior to it. (umm) So I think that's what they were really trying to push for was like the same audience, the same, oh this is going to be huge and epic.

It wasn't that good. (uhh) Three hundred was completely epic, this if if (stutter) you want a comparison just three hundred here, ten thousand BC here. (umm)

I would rent this one or maybe ask for it for like a holiday present just so I don't have to spend money on it. But the special effects are great, historically accurate no.

I'm going to give this a two out of five. Thanks.
