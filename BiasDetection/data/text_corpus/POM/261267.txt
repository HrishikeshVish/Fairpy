Expotv, let's talk about Nim's Island. Alright, now, it's a kid's movie okay? But now overall though kid's movies usually are pretty good overall, like as movies. This movie was not. Let me tell you why, alright? Now,

well the acting was good, especially Abigail Breslin. That was the only good thing about the movie. Now other times it's just like the story line wasn't that good for a kid's movie, you know? Normally you can go see a kid's movie no matter what age you are and love it. Like, I mean, all Disney stuff, everything. Pixar, whatever. This one just it just didn't have that many elements. I mean there definitely was not like any like adult humor, you know, that only adults get and stuff.

(stutter) I don't even know if kids would like it. It's just, I mean it's a really fantasy movie, there's a lot of like weird stuff. I mean that's cool but Jodie Foster doesn't do a great job, you know, so the only good thing about the acting is Abigail Breslin. And like some of the camera work is just like oh this is horrible. I mean on a on a (stutter) scale of like stars I would give it definitely like two stars out of five. I mean if you have to see it go see it because your little kid might want to see it or something, or your little brother or sister. But overall it's just really not worth seeing. I mean you could definitely take them to see something else.

If they're enthusiastic about seeing it take them because, I mean, maybe they might like it but you will have to sit through something that's really you're just like "I do not want to be here". So I mean if you if you (stutter) have to, go see it. But I mean, it's called Nim's Island, I'm giving it two stars.
