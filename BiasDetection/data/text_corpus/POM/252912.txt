Hello Expo TV. Tonight I would like to share with you Men Seeking Women, starring Will Ferrel and a couple other horribly unfunny people.

(uhh) I highly advise you stay as far away (uhh) from this movie as you can. It's one of those things where

a company has a movie with someone in it and they realize that person is now famous so they pull it out and put it on DVD to trick people into buying it because it has someone they love, being Will Ferrel. (uhh) It has him right there on the cover, (uhh) twice, in the picture and standing here. He's all over the back, because no one else cares about the other people in this movie. (uhh) It has the little smarmy glasses wearing guy from Murphy Brown. (uhh)

It's just not awesome. It's about these best friends

and there's something about them trying to get married in a certain amount of time. I honestly can't even tell you that I watched the movie all the way through. It made me sick to my stomach. (uhh)

Like I said it's cheap, I think it runs like five bucks which is why I picked it up, I should of known better. But

(uhh) consider this a warning to avoid Men Seeking Women. (uhh) Will Ferrel the parts that I watched you know he's kind of funny but the writing in it's terrible and they don't really give him much to work with and it seems like he kind of may have had a jerk director that wouldn't let him you know do his thing and experiment and play around and

be as (uhh)

(uhh) improvious as he would want to be. So I highly recommend you stay as far away from Men Seeking Women as you possibly can.
