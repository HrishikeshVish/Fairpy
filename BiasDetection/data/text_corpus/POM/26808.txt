Hi. Today I will be reviewing this Primus Live two-thousand-four DVD. (uhh) I went to a show in Berkeley on this tour so I thought I'd check out the DVD. It's actually from a set in Chicago and basically the premise behind this tour was that they did, 

they had no opening band, their first set they just played (umm) songs off of all their albums except for Frizzle Fry, which their second set they played the entire CD. And this is just a good account of what it was like. 

(uhh) It's an indoor theater and the crowd has a lot of energy.  The camera camera (stutter) works really well and the sound's really good on this DVD. (uhh) If you're into Primus you'll definitely want to check this out. If you're not sure what their tour's like you'll also want to check this out. 

(umm) The run time on it is about two and a half hours so you get a lot for your money cause you can get this for about ten dollars, if not less. And (umm)

so you can pick this up probably at Tower Records or at Borders if you're looking for it. And, yeah, check it out. Thank you.
