Hey everyone and welcome to Review It, by Dianna Vealy. (umm) The holiday movie that I chose was The Polar Express.

I chose The Polar Express because this year we had a child that because he's older he thinks there is no Santa. So this year we (umm) did some movies and this movie was one of em that I picked out. (umm) The reason why I picked this out is because there is a child that lost his spirit about Christmas and then he was taken on a train to the North Pole and it kinda explains, you know the gist of magical Christmas. (umm) To me, I know that there is no Santa. However I want my children to think that there is one. (umm) This is a great material for you if you do have a child that

is stubborn and chooses not to believe. (umm) When we watched this movie, we got to sit down, have popcorn. It was a family night event. We ordered pizza, popped popcorn, have soda, sit down, be close to each other. (umm) This is a great movie around the holidays to enjoy your family and watch it. So I hope sometime soon that you can grab your kids and watch it yourself. Maybe you can use this for your next holiday

movie. (umm) Thank you and have a great day.
