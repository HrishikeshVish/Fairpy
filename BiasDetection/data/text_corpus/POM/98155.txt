I have a math problem for you now. 

What is a really awesome Asian guy plus a really cocky 

scrawny, 

not so funny as he thinks he is black guy?

What happens when you add them together

and multiply it times two?

Well

for you mathematicians out there you'd guess it, it's Rush Hour Two with Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan.

I'll let you guess who the really cool Asian guy is.

(uhh) It's a really good movie as you can see Chris Tucker here is doing a little {mumble} you know (umm)

probably kind of insulting to the Asian people maybe who are really good at this stuff or

anybody who's good at this stuff.

The movie is decent. The movie is actually probably a one out of five.

I watched it when I was younger because I think in middle school,

there was like a really cool thing to go see Rush Hour because it was rated R.

(uhh) But we couldn't get in because we were eleven.

But some people snuck in and sat in the aisles.

I didn't think these movies are that great and in fact I don't even remember what Rush Hour was about.

(uhh) Much less Rush Hour Two.

That's why it's a one out of five, I have seen it.

(uhh) Basically Chris Tucker's a cop, he's a detective they get together and have some crazy antics.

You know, across the Middle East and America.

One out of five. You should probably see it if you have time.

Plus, they get to go to a (uhh) Asian Japanese, (stutter) what it, (uhh) Asian massage parlor.

That was really cool because you get to pick like five girls, so.

Rock on, one out of five.
