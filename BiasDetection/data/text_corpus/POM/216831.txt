This is my review of the movie Presumed Innocent.

(uhh) If you've seen some of my other reviews, you know I really like Harrison Ford and have a lot of his movies.

(umm) Watch em over and over again. He's one of my top ten favorite actors.

It's a mystery type story.

(umm) Harrison Ford plays a prosecutor and he's having an affair with a

coworker who's murdered and he has to try and

clear his name after he's accused of the crime and have to find out who really

did it and it's very suspenseful.

(umm) Very good, dramatic movie.
