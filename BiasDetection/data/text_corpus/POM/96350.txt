I'm not quite sure why this is in my video collection.

(uhh) Probably because I bought it about ten years ago,

or actually I probably got it for Christmas.

But The Fast and the Furious starring Paul Walk, Paul Walk, Paul Walker and Vin Diesil.

This is a terrible movie.

(uhh) There's really not much to say. It's about people that race cars

(uhh) I don't understand the whole concept of it.

Okay, let's, let's (stutter) spend ten-thousand dollars on a Honda or a Toyota,

something that sounds like you're about to go mow my yard.

Let's put forty to fifty-thousand dollars into this car and then go racing and be like, Oh, what's up man? You've got a ten second car.

No. Why don't you take your money and go buy a viper? 

Why don't you go buy something that's actually fast and has a lot of muscle and enough torque to actually, like, bend your little honda civic in half or something?

So overall I don't understand the concept. I think it promotes high schoolers to go buy Honda Civics and make them wice wockets. But

other than that it's not that great. (umm)

It's really corny, you know. It was,

it's, don't watch it. Zero out of five. Fast and the Furious.
