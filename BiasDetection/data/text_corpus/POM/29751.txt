Hello and welcome to my review of 

Pinata, Survival Island. 

This is a story of 

a bunch of college students who go to an island for 

(umm) a treasure hunt. 

And they end up breaking this ancient pinata which releases some demon 

and then 

of course, chaos ensues. 

This movie is pretty bad. 

It is 

(umm) {laugh} it's less than a B movie. 

The only reason to see this is (umm) if you are a fan of Jaime Pressly or Nicholas Brandon, 

(umm) those are the two stars. 

(uhh) Jaime Pressly of course from My Name Is Earl fame and Nicholas Brendon from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. 

Only reason why the, to really to see this movie. The special features 

there aren't very many, there's a feature commentary and some other 

junk but who who (stutter) really cares because this movie is pretty bad. 

(umm) I I (stutter) have to mention that on the back of the dvd it actually says evil has gone wack. 

So if that gives you any indication of where this movie is going, 

(umm) if that doesn't I don't know what will. 

So this is Pinata, Survival Island. 

Unless you're really, really bored, I'd stay away.
