Hey there expo. So regrettably yesterday I went to go see Next Day Air. (umm)

One of my poorer choices, to say the least. (umm) But it was a rainy afternoon, didn't really anything to do so headed out for a matinee. Figured, you know, lower price, can't lose too bad, right? (umm) Well I went to go see Next Day Air cause (umm) I'd already seen Star Trek and I heard awful things about Wolverine. So (umm)

yeah. This was (stutter) supposed to be a comedy. (uhh) It wasn't that funny. I mean there was some funny parts, (umm) I'll I'll (stutter) give it that. But overall it wasn't fun to watch, (stutter) the acting was

subpar to say the least. (umm) It did have (uhh) Turk from Scrubs fame (umm) and Avon Barksdale from The Wire so some actors that I was familiar with. (umm) But they did not really deliver the package, so to speak, (umm) in this, in this (stutter) film. Brief synopsis (umm)

a cocaine shipment from Mexico gets delivered to the wrong apartment in Philadelphia and chaos and hilarity ensue,

or at least they're supposed to. (uhh) Chaos definitely happened. Hilarious

(uhh) not so much.

It had its funny moments but overall I would definitely not watch it again and if I had the choice I would go back and not see it. (uhh) So that's, yeah Next Day Air. It's in theaters now. If you're looking for a way to waste your afternoon, go ahead and see it.
