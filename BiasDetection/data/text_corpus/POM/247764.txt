Hi today I'm reviewing the DVD of the movie Better Off Dead.

Better Off Dead is a story of a young man from northern California played with enthusiasm by John Cusack. Starring one of his mid,

his many mid-eighties teen comedies and just a few (stutter) years away from his breakout role in the movie Say Anything.

Cusack's family is mostly deranged, as are the supporting characters that fill the world of this teenage ski comedy.

As Cusack's character tries to win back his girlfriend from a ski jock, he begins to fall for a French foreign exchange student.

As you watch the movie you'll probably remember the smaller characters than anything else, including the Asian guy who talks like Howard Cosell, and the newspaper delivery boy who wants his two dollars. There is also a very bizarre scene which you can see behind me, featuring a claymation hamburger version of David Lee Roth's (stutter) dancing and singing to the Van Halen song Everybody Wants Some.

The DVD is completely bare-bones, which is about what you would expect the kind of treatment you would expect for a little-known eighties teen comedy. It is worth a look if you like these kinds of movies, or if you're just a fan of John Cusack. What it lacks in great acting it makes up for in fun characters and one-liners. Overall I give the movie only about a two-and-a-half out of five stars, and the extras only a one out of five.
