Hey guys what's up. Welcome to my video review of Saving Private Ryan.

(uhh) It's widescreen edition.

(umm) This includes, special features 

(umm) like

messages from Steven Spielberg about the movie. You've got behind the scenes stuff.
(umm) Has Tom Hanks in it. It's definitely a great movie. Action in it, war, it's git some funny parts in it too but I don't think it's classed by comedy.

(umm) It's rated R for restricted, so you gotta be seventeen or older to watch it, or buy it for that xxx, or matter.

(umm) Like I said, it's a great movie.

(umm) I recommend it to anyone who 

likes Tom Hanks or 

war movies, stuff like that.

(umm) I'll give it a five out of five stars. 

(uhh) You can find it at Wal Mart, probably like five bucks now. If you wanna rent from Blockbuster, it's definitely worth the rent, or you know just buy it like I said at Wal Mart. It's worth that too. So 

(umm) like I said, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes war or Tom Hanks or action movies.

(umm) Thanks for watching this video review.
