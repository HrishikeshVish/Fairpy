Right here with me today I have the (umm) little heard of DVD called From Justin to Kelly. (umm) This is actually a musical which came out (umm) a few years ago so (umm) of course it's not as a famous anymore. (umm) It's got America's favorite (umm) (stutter) 

people from the American Idol show (umm) Kelly Clarkson and Justin (uhh) Guarini. (umm) So that's of course the two (stutter) major (umm) stars in this show. (umm) Because these are great (umm)

two very talented singers of course this has got to be a musical. It's about (umm) a few people going with their friends to Miami for spring break and then they (uhh) meet up. It's got a lot of music, its got a lot dancing and (uhh) basically the fun never stops in the sun. So (umm)

I wouldn't really recommend getting this because it's (uhh)

there's a reason it wasn't, it didn't get (umm) such good (uhh) ratings because it's actually quite (stutter) a boring (uhh) plot. There's not much of a plot to it, it's just (uhh) people dancing and singing on the beach and (umm) 

that's about it. So if you're looking for something with a good plot (umm) I wouldn't suggest this, but maybe if you're looking for something like a sing along type I would suggest this because (uhh) the (umm)

the the (stutter) subtitles actually (umm) the captions and everything actually show up as they're saying the words so it's almost like a sing along kind of movie. So (uhh) in that case if you like that kind of thing I would recommend this to you.
