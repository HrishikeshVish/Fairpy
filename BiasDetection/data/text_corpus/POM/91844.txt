Hi I'm Marshal Hammer and right now I want to share with you this film, I've got it on DVD. It probably cost me about ten to fifteen dollars. I bought it on half dot com. This is Bound uhh starring Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, and Joe Pantoliano and Patoliano is incredible in this movie, I've never seen him play a part this well. (umm) This is really a kind of a thriller, it's (umm)

it's on the fence between

(umm) a gangster movie and a lesbian love story. (umm)

Bound keeps me in suspense every time I watched it and I've seen it about a million times now. Maybe that's an exaggeration. But I've I've (stutter) watched it a lot. I've definitely (umm) made it so this film has paid for itself over and over again. (umm) This isn't going to be a film that you can watch with your children, (umm) it's probably going to be something that you can watch on a date or (umm) with friends. And (umm) on the scale of one to ten. I'm sorry, on the scale of one to five I would give this a five. (umm) If it were a scale of one to ten I'd give it a ten {laugh} definitely. So check this out. Bound starring Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon, and Joe Pantoliano.
