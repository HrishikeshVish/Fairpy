Hey (uhh) this is a review 

of DOA: Dead or Alive. 

(umm) 

Probably never heard of it. 

(umm) 

It wasn't really advertised too much 

(uhh) probably with good reason they were probably embarrassed that they made it. It was (uhh), 

it's a terrible movie. 

It had 

very little plot. 

(umm) 

The action, the fighting was good I suppose but (uhh) 

everything else 

was terrible. (uhh) 

Well I guess (uhh) 

the cast was, 

the cast was good I liked the cast. 

But (uhh) 

not for their acting abilities, mostly 

and it was mostly eye candy but (umm) 

yeah, it was 

pretty bad movie I'd stay away from it. (umm) 

I wouldn't even 

rent it unless you're 

very, very bored but there are a lot of 

better movies out there and 

give it a 

two out of five. 

So (uhh) 

yeah. 

Stay away.
