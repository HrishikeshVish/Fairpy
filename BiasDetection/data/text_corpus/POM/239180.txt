What's up ExpoTV, I'm watching right now the Bourne Supremacy. It's the (uhh) second movie of the three Bourne films, and it's starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. This is the widescreen version. (uhh) It's rated PG-thirteen for violence, intense action and brief language, and (uhh) it's an hour and forty-nine minutes long. (uhh) In this movie, Matt Damon's character Jason Bourne (uhh) it it (stutter) starts off (uhh) after the first one and  what happens is, he's just hanging out, trying to hide out from (uhh) the people who came after him in the first one. And they actually find him and his girlfriend. And these people kill his girlfriend, so the rest of the movie is pretty much about him coming back, and like (uhh)

like chasing after these guys and trying to assassinate them. But (uhh) it's a really awesome movie, Matt Damon's (uhh) like an awesome actor and all the action is really crazy and it's really fast-paced, so if you're into good action movies this is the one to get. The Bourne Supremacy. I give it a five out of five.
